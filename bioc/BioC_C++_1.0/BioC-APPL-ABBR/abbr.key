Ab3P algorithm in

Abbreviation definition identification based on automatic precision estimates.

A minor deficiency of the BioC adaptation is that Ab3P returns the
text of the long form and short form, not the exact locations. The
adaptor attempts to find the original location, but it might be
fooled.


    collection:  10 random PubMed documents with ASCII text split into
                 sentences and tokens by the MedPost tokenizer
                 
                 Original source sentence.xml

    source:  PubMed

    date:  yyyymmdd. Date documents downloaded from PubMed

    document:  Title and possibly abstract from a PubMed reference

    id:  PubMed id

    passage:  Either title or abstract

    type:  "title" or "abstract"

    offset: The original Unicode byte offsets were not updated after
            the ASCII conversion.

            PubMed is extracted from an XML file, so literal offsets
            would not be useful. Title has an offset of zero, while
            the abstract is assumed to begin after the title and one
            space. These offsets at least sequence the abstract after
            the title.

    annotation:  Abbreviations

    id:  sequential integers from 0 within each passage

    type: "LF" or "SF"

    offset: A document offset to where the short form or long form
            begins in the passage. Sum of the passage offset and the
            local offset within the passage.

    length: The length of the short form or long form.

    text:  Original text of the short form or long form.

    relation:  Long form / short form pair

    id:  R99, where the number counts from zero within a passage

    type:  "abbr"

    label: "sf" or "lf"

    ref_id:  id of the sf or lf annotation as appropriate
