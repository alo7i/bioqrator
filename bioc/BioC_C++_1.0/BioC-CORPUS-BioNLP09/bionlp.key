BioNLP'09 Shared Task

          The BioNLP'09 Shared Task concerns the recognition of bio-molecular
          events (bio-events) that appear in biomedical literature.

http://www.nactem.ac.uk/tsujii/GENIA/SharedTask/index.shtml

This shared task dealt with proteins and events related to proteins.
Participants were provided several sets of data: sample, train,
development, and test. Information for each document was provided in 3
files: the document text (.txt), gold standard protein references
(.a1) and the events related to these proteins (.a2).

The question was could the data be placed in the BioC format and then
successfully extracted. The .txt and .a1 files were reproduced
exactly. The .a2 were reproduced, but with lines out of order and some
white space inconsistencies lost. After sorting, 'diff -w' reported no
differences.


bionlp_corpus.xml

    source:  BioNLP'09 Shared Task

    date:  yyyymmdd. Date BioC files created from shared task date

    document:  Shared Task document

    id:  Shared Task document id (PubMed id)

    passage:  Either title or abstract

    infon type:  "title" or "abstract"
                  title is first line of .txt file, abstract is the second

    offset: Offset into the .txt file.

    text: The original text from the shared task .txt files


bionlp_annotate.xml

    source:  BioNLP'09 Shared Task

    date:  yyyymmdd. Date BioC files created from shared task date

    document:  Shared Task document

    id:  Shared Task document id (PubMed id)

    passage:  Either title or abstract

    annotation: Protein names and locations from .a1 files

    infon type:  Protein. Since only proteins are annotated in the .a1
    files, this value is redundant and unnecessary. It does show how
    multiple types of annotaions could be identified.

    offset: Offset into the .txt file as given in the .a1 file

    length: Length of protein name

    text: The original text of the protein name from the shared task
    .txt files 


bionlp_relations.xml

    source:  BioNLP'09 Shared Task

    date:  yyyymmdd. Date BioC files created from shared task date

    document:  Shared Task document

    id:  Shared Task document id (PubMed id)

    passage:  Either title or abstract

    annotation: Event trigger words and other annotations from .a2 files

    infon type:  Type of event

    offset: Offset into the .txt file as given in the .a1 file

    length: Length of trigger word

    text: The original text of the protein name from the shared task
    .txt files 

    relation: There are 3 types of relations in the .a2 files:
    equivalences, modifications, and events. Each described separately
    below.

    Equivalence:

    id: *99 (.a2 file does not have number)

    infon type: Equiv

    refid: Protein annotation. There should be 2 or more ref_ids.

    role: Equiv


    Modify:

    id: M99

    infon type: type of modification

    refid: modified event

    role: type duplicated


    Event:

    id: E99

    infon type: type of event

    refid: actor or participant in the event.

    role: Relation of refid to event. First is a repeat of the
          type. Others include Theme or Cause.
