ERROR 10372828: 10439674	. 	INTRODUCTION : The goal of this study is to analyse the follow-up of patients who underwent percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty and the predicting factors of event-free survival . METHODS : We analysed 220 consecutive valvuloplasty performed between 1988 and 1996 in order to establish the incidence of events and the baseline and postprocedural characteristics predicting events , during a mean follow-up of 42 months . RESULTS : Overall survival was 94.7 % , and event-free survival was 59.2 % at 96 months . We analyzed the baseline characteristics in order to predict the mid-term outcome that atrial fibrillation , age &gt; or = 56 years , and echocardiographic score &gt; or = 9 were baseline characteristics related to adverse events in follow up . An index based on the number of adverse factors in the baseline characteristics provided a significant difference in concerning the number of follow up to even-free between the group without baseline adverse characteristics and the group with two , or three adverse characteristics . Among the postprocedural characteristics , while patients with mitral valve area after valvuloplasty &gt; or = 1.5 cm2 had an event-free survival of 72.9 % at 96 months , those with postprocedural mitral valve area &lt; 1.5 cm2 had an event-free survival of 10.5 % . CONCLUSIONS : Mid-term event-free survival after percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty can be predicted by baseline and postprocedural characteristics . Age &gt; or = 56 , echocardiographic score &gt; or = 9 and atrial fibrillation are baseline factors related with adverse events . Patients with 0 or 1 baseline adverse factors do not have significant differences concerning mid-term outcome while , those with 2 , and above all , 3 adverse baseline characteristics have a poorer event-free survival . Mitral valve area &gt; or = 1.5 cm2 is the only postprocedural independent predictor of event-free survival . 	1999	1999-08-10	Revista espa√±ola de cardiolog√≠a;1999 Jul;52;7;503-11;	Hern√°ndez Garc√≠a,J M,JM;Castillo Castro,J L,JL;Alonso Briales,J H,JH;Alvarez de Cienfuegos Rivera,F,F;Bullones Ram√≠rez,J,J;Alvarez Rubiera,J,J;Rubio Alcaide,A,A;G√≥mez Doblas,J J,JJ;de Mora Mart√≠n,M,M;Zafra S√°nchez,J,J;Urda Valc√°rcel,T,T;Conejo Mu√	-1.42551

The sprouting of new blood vessels , or angiogenesis , is necessary for any solid tumor to grow large enough to cause life-threatening disease . Vascular endothelial growth factor is one of the key promoters of tumor induced angiogenesis . VEGF receptors , the tyrosine kinases Flt-1 and KDR , are expressed on vascular endothelial cells and initiate angiogenesis upon activation by VEGF . 1-Anilino -- phthalazines , such as CGP 79787D , reversibly inhibit Flt-1 and KDR with IC values &lt; 0.1 microM. CGP 79787D also blocks the VEGF-induced receptor autophosphorylation in CHO cells ectopically expressing the KDR receptor . Modification of the 1-anilino moiety afforded derivatives with higher selectivity for the VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases Flt-1 and KDR compared to the related receptor tyrosine kinases PDGF-R and c-Kit . Since these 1-anilino-phthalazines are orally well absorbed , these compounds qualify for further profiling and as candidates for clinical evaluation . 	2000	2000-07-06	Journal of medicinal chemistry;2000 Jun 15;43;12;2310-23;	Bold,G,G;Altmann,K H,KH;Frei,J,J;Lang,M,M;Manley,P W,PW;Traxler,P,P;Wietfeld,B,B;Br√ºggen,J,J;Buchdunger,E,E;Cozens,R,R;Ferrari,S,S;Furet,P,P;Hofmann,F,F;Martiny-Baron,G,G;Mestan,J,J;R√∂sel,J,J;Sills,M,M;Stover,D,D;Acemoglu,F,F;Boss,E,E;Emmenegger,R,R;L√	-0.504284
ERROR 11048695: 11132442	. 	OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the usefulness of the NMP-22 test in the diagnosis of bladder cancer ; to calculate the ideal cutoff and to compare the results among NMP-22 , voided urine cytology and cystoscopy . MATERIAL AND METHODS : 166 patients having clinical suspicious of bladder cancer or in follow-up due to a previous one . The exclusions criteria were : other urological conditions , radiotherapy in the last three months , systemic chemotherapy in the last month , recent vesical trauma or indwelling catheter . Prior cystoscopy a recent voided urinary sample was sent to the pathology and biochemistry laboratory to perform cytology and NMP-22 . A TUR was performed in patients with bladder tumour . The cutoff was calculated with ROC curves . For each test we calculate sensitivity , specificity , positive and negative predictive value . We use the McNemar test to compare the results , all of which are expressed with a confidence interval of 95 % . RESULTS : The ideal cutoff was 6 U / ml. We have a global sensitivity of 82.75 % for NMP-22 and 67.9 for cytology ; the specificity was 80 % and 94.12 % respectively . By grade the sensitivity was 72.22 % G1 , 70.97 % G2 and 100 % G3 for NMP-22 and 44.44 % , 58.06 % and 90.62 % for cytology . By stage it was 68.42 % Ta , 83.33 % T1 and 100 T2 or more for NMP-22 and 36.84 % , 75 % and 85.71 % for cytology . With the cystoscopy we obtained a 100 % sensitivity and 89.41 % specificity . CONCLUSIONS : The NMP-22 is a useful test for the diagnosis of bladder cancer ; is more sensitive and less specific than cytology . We think it can replace the cytology in the diagnosis and follow-up of bladder cancer . The ideal cutoff is 6 U / ml. 	2001	2001-01-02	Actas urologicas espa√±olas;2000 Oct;24;9;715-20;	Guti√©rrez Ba√±os,J L,JL;Rebollo Rodrigo,M H,MH;Antol√≠n Ju√°rez,F,F;Mart√≠n Garc√≠a,B,B;Hern√°ndez Rodr√≠guez,R,R;Portillo Mart√≠n,J A,JA;Correas G√≥mez,M A,MA;Del Valle Schaan,J I,JI;Roca Edreira,A,A;De Diego Rodr√≠guez,E,E;Rado Vel√°zquez,M A,MA;Hern√	-1.02304
ERROR 11057380: 11141413	. 	BACKGROUND : The RICARDIN Study multicenter study of cardiovascular risk factors in children and adolescents has described the standards of normality of blood cholesterol levels in the Spanish school population . The objective of the present study was to compare mean values of cholesterol between different regions of Spain , and to compare the global mean with a pool international study . Also , the pattern of total cholesterol and cHDL by age and sex using mathematical model is described , and comparison with two international studies carried out in USA and Japan is performed . SUBJECTS AND METHODS : 10,683 children aged 6 to 18 were selected from 7 different Spanish provinces . Blood samples were obtained by capilar puncture . RESULTS : Mean values of total cholesterol was different among provinces , and globally , were lower than the international pooled population , although the pattern observed in each population was very similar . Total cholesterol curve for Spanish boys showed a curvilinear trend that can be estimated through a cubic function that explains 89 % of observed data , while for girls the best estimate was obtained through an inverse function . cHDL for boys showed a cubic function as the best estimate , while for girls the best estimate was obtained through a quadratic function . CONCLUSIONS : There are important physiological variations of total cholesterol level by age and sex in children and adolescents . The pattern of cholesterol does not follow a linear model but a curvilinear one , that need to be considered in clinically assessing individual determinations of cholesterol , since highest percentiles can vary by age and sex . 	2001	2001-01-06	Medicina cl√≠nica;2000 Nov 18;115;17;644-9;	Brotons Cuixart,C,C;Gabriel S√°nchez,R,R;Mu√±iz Garc√≠a,J,J;Ribera Sol√©,A,A;M√°laga Guerrero,S,S;S√°enz Aranzubia,P E,PE;D√≠az Gonz√°lez-Blanco,M T,MT;S√°nchez Bayle,M,M;Sand√≠n Dom√≠nguez,M,M;Bosch Gim√©nez,V,V;Gorostiza Garai,E,E;Labarthe,D R,DR;Fern√	-1.3802

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis has become the gold standard of molecular methods in epidemiological investigations . In spite of its high resolving power , use of the method has been hampered by inadequate laboratory-to-laboratory reproducibility . In the project described here we have addressed this problem by organizing a multilaboratory effort in which the same bacterial strains were analyzed by twenty investigators in thirteen different laboratories according to an indentical protocol , which is reproduced here in detail . PFGE patterns obtained were analyzed at a central laboratory in order to identify specific technical problems that produced substandard macrorestriction patterns . The results including the specific technical problems and their most likely causes are described in this communication . Also listed are seven major epidemic clones of MRSA which have been characterized by molecular fingerprinting techniques and the prototypes of which have been deposited at the American Type Culture Collection , from where they will be available for interested investigators for the purpose of typing MRSA isolates . It is hoped that this communication will contribute to the improvement of the reproducibility and technical / aesthetic quality of PFGE analysis . 	2001	2001-01-06	Microbial drug resistance (Larchmont, N.Y.);2000;6;3;189-98;	Chung,M,M;de Lencastre,H,H;Matthews,P,P;Tomasz,A,A;Adamsson,I,I;Aires de Sousa,M,M;Camou,T,T;Cocuzza,C,C;Corso,A,A;Couto,I,I;Dominguez,A,A;Gniadkowski,M,M;Goering,R,R;Gomes,A,A;Kikuchi,K,K;Marchese,A,A;Mato,R,R;Melter,O,O;Oliveira,D,D;Palacio,R,R;S√°-Le√	-1.51269

ERROR 11464519: 11566395	Effect of pH and soybean cultivars on the quantitative analyses of soybean rhizobia populations . 	Quantitative analyses of fast- and slow-growing soybean rhizobia populations in soils of four different provinces of China have been carried out using the most probable number technique . All soils contained fast- and slow-growing soybean rhizobia . Asiatic and American soybean cultivars grown at acid , neutral and alkaline pH were used as trapping hosts for FSR and SSR strains . The estimated total indigenous soybean-rhizobia populations of the Xinjiang and Shan Dong soil samples greatly varied with the different soybean cultivars used . The soybean cultivar and the pH at which plants were grown also showed clear effects on the FSR / SSR rations isolated from nodules . Results of competition experiments between FSR and SSR strains supported the importance of the soybean cultivar and the pH on the outcome of competition for nodulation between FSR and SSR strains . In general , nodule occupancy by FSRs significantly increased at alkaline pH . Bacterial isolates from soybean cultivar Jing Dou 19 inoculated with Xinjiang soil nodulate cultivars Heinong 33 and Williams very poorly . Plasmid and lipopolysaccharide profiles and PCR-RAPD analyses showed that cultivar Jing Dou 19 had trapped a diversity of FSR strains . Most of the isolates from soybean cultivar Heinong 33 inoculated with Xinjiang soil were able to nodulate Heinong 33 and Williams showed very similar , or identical , plasmid , LPS and PCR-RAPD profiles . All the strains isolated from Xinjiang province , regardless of the soybean cultivar used for trapping , showed similar nodulation factor profiles as judged by thin layer chromatographic analyses . These results indicate that the existence of soybean rhizobia sub-populations showing marked cultivar specificity , can affect the estimation of total soybean rhizobia populations indigenous to the soil , and can also affect the diversity of soybean rhizobial strains isolated from soybean nodules . 	2001	2001-09-22	Journal of biotechnology;2001 Oct 4;91;2-3;243-55;	Yang,S S,SS;Bellog√≠n,R A,RA;Buend√≠a,A,A;Camacho,M,M;Chen,M,M;Cubo,T,T;Daza,A,A;D√≠az,C L,CL;Espuny,M R,MR;Guti√©rrez,R,R;Harteveld,M,M;Li,X H,XH;Lyra,M C,MC;Madinabeitia,N,N;Medina,C,C;Miao,L,L;Ollero,F J,FJ;Olsthoorn,M M,MM;Rodr√≠guez,D N,DN;Santamar√	-1.21033

There was a statistically significant difference in in-hospital mortality among the classes . Classes B and C were the strongest indicators of in-hospital mortality . By multivariate analysis TT or PCI did not reduce mortality in Classes A and B , but a clinically favorable trend in mortality reduction was documented : both methods decreased RV dysfunction in Class B and PCI reduced the risk of mortality in Class C . CONCLUSIONS : Classification into types A , B or C allows the prediction of mortality .

There are however no basic differences between individual groups . The questionnaires were handed only to patients who had maintenance treatment for more than one year and thus patients were eliminated where maintenance treatment was discontinued because of undesirable effects . To give a general idea of the tolerance of the above maintenance treatment the authors mention that to the date of Aug . 31 , 2001 113 patients were randomized into one of the branches of maintenance treatment . Maintenance treatment had to be discontinued in 6 % patients . Reduction of interferon doses in 20 % patients usually because of cytopenia but also on account of psychic problem . To the question what length of prolongation of life compensates the undesirable effects of maintenance treatment the following replies were obtained from patients receiving ID , possibly I : 3 months -- 47.6 and 38.3 % , 6 months -- 4.3 and 10.6 % , 9 months -- 0 and 4.3 % , 12 months -- 47.6 and 46.8 % of the addressed patients . In reply to the question whether the patients would prefer , assuming equal effectiveness , a maintenance monotherapy with interferon alpha or dexamethazone more patients preferred interferon to dexamethasone . For practice ensues from this article informing on undesirable effects of maintenance treatment and the effect of maintenance treatment on the quality of life : 1. the necessity of thorough knowledge of physicians of all possible undesirable effects as only a doctor knowing possible undesirable effects of treatment can recognize them , 2. regular monitoring not only of the activity of the basic disease , but also undesirable effects of maintenance treatment and the influence of treatment on the patients &apos; quality of life , 3. the necessity to assess the quality of life in clinical trials as an important parameter for deciding on the way of treatment . 	2002	2002-04-24	VnitrÃÜn√≠ l√©karÃÜstv√≠;2002 Mar;48;3;216-29;	Adam,Z,Z;Pour,L,L;Svobodn√≠k,A,A;Scudla,V,V;Salajka,F,F;Vytrasov√°,M,M;Bacovsk√Ω,J,J;Sch√ºtzov√°,M,M;Koza,V,V;Sumn√°,E,E;Frankov√°,H,H;Lehanka,F,F;Gumulec,J,J;Stavarov√°,Y,Y;Cahov√°,S,S;Vr√°nov√°,M,M;Dost√°lov√°,V,V;Kessler,P,P;Walterov√°,L,L;Meluz√≠nov√	-1.74195

Age-dependent associations between type 1 diabetes risk genes HLA , INS VNTR , and CTLA-4 and autoantibodies to GAD65 , ICA512 / IA-2 , insulin , and islet cells were determined by logistic regression analysis in 971 incident patients with type 1 diabetes and 702 control subjects aged 0-34 years . GADAs were associated with HLA-DQ2 in young but not in older patients . Autoantibodies to insulin were negatively associated with age but positively associated with DQ8 and with INS VNTR , supporting possible immune tolerance induction . ICA512 / IA-2 were negatively associated with age and with DQ2 but positively associated with DQ8 . Males were more likely than females to be negative for GADA , autoantibodies to islet cells , and all four autoantibody markers . The CTLA-4 3 &apos; end microsatellite marker was not associated with any of the autoantibodies .

Treatment facilities as well as psychological support are of great importance to minimize these side effects . In 1998 the programme of psychological support was introduced in 7 Polish paediatric haematology / oncology centres . Psychological adjustment of patients treated in each centre was examined 5 yrs after the termination of therapy . At the same time children with new diagnosis of cancer were monitored psychologically along with the psychological support programme . Psychological status of each patient was examined with the following tests : Cattell &apos; s questionnaires , Manifest Anxiety Scale , Spielberger &apos; s inventories , Wechsler Intelligence Scale . The programme of psychological support was based on guidelines of SIOP Psychosocial Committee and included such elements as informing about diagnosis and treatment , explaining any doubt , maintaining an open communication , educational care in the periods of treatment , encouraging to activity even during periods of discomfort . The analysis showed that most of the participating centres could only provide some elements of the support programme . The main problem was to convince medical staff to inform children on diagnosis and treatment plans . Preliminary results of the study indicate that full psychological support for children with cancer and their families from the beginning of therapy can result in improvement in psychological adjustment .

To evaluate whether acute effects of ozone , nitrogen dioxide , and particulates with mass median diameter less than 10 micro m could be attenuated by antioxidant vitamin supplementation , we conducted a randomized trial using a double-blinded design . Children with asthma who were residents of Mexico City were randomly given a daily supplement of vitamins or a placebo and were followed from October 1998 to April 2000 . Pulmonary function tests were carried out twice a week in the morning . During the follow-up observation period , the mean 1-hour maximum ozone level was 102 ppb , and the mean 24-hour average PM level was 56.7 micro g / m . In children with moderate and severe asthma , ozone levels 1 day before spirometry were inversely associated significantly with forced expiratory flow , FEV , and peak expiratory flow in the placebo group after adjusting for potential confounding factors . No association between ozone and lung functions was observed in the supplement group . We observed significant differences in lung function decrements between groups for FEF and PEF . Our results suggest that supplementation with antioxidants might modulate the impact of ozone exposure on the small airways of children with moderate to severe asthma . 	2002	2002-09-03	American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine;2002 Sep 1;166;5;703-9;	Romieu,Isabelle,I;Sienra-Monge,Juan Jos√©,JJ;Ram√≠rez-Aguilar,Matiana,M;T√©llez-Rojo,Martha Mar√≠a,MM;Moreno-Mac√≠as,Hortensia,H;Reyes-Ruiz,Norma Isabel,NI;del R√≠o-Navarro,Blanca Estela,BE;Ruiz-Navarro,Mar√≠a X√≥chitl,MX;Hatch,Gary,G;Slade,Ralph,R;Hern√	-1.11513

AIM : To report our 8 years experience with adult OLT at Clinica Alemana de Santiago . PATIENTS AND METHODS : In all transplantations done at the center , we recorded patient &apos; s overall data and survival , postoperative medical and surgical complications and causes of death . RESULTS : Between November 1993 and September 2001 , 51 consecutive OLT were performed in 44 patients . Thirty eight patients presented with chronic and 6 with acute or sub-acute liver failure . Cryptogenic cirrhosis and hepatitis C infection were the most common causes for OLT . Postoperative bleeding and extrahepatic biliary complications were seen in 17.6 and 21.5 % of cases respectively . Acute rejection , bacterial infections , CMV infection or disease and post OLT hemodialysis were the most common medical complications . The overall 1 and 5 years survival rates were 80 % and 73 % respectively . Considering exclusively the last 22 OLT performed since January 1999 , the 1 year survival rate has improved to 91 % . CONCLUSIONS : Liver transplantation in Chile provides a good long term survival with acceptable morbidity , due to a multidisciplinary approach management . The survival rates have improved over the last few years probably due to better surgical techniques , ICU care and immunosuppression .

ERROR 12116716: 12292307	Determinants of infant and child mortality in Mongolia . 	This study describes differences in infant and child mortality in Mongolia and examines the main possible determinants of mortality . The policy implications are discussed . Data were obtained from the 1994 Demographic Survey of Mongolia among 2030 women and 1026 men aged 15-49 years and 4685 children . Analysis was limited by the small sample size and the unavailability of data on access to health services and nutrition . Birth history data revealed 25.9 % of births in the capital city , 24 % in provincial capitals , and 50.1 % in rural areas . The sex ratio was 100 females to 102 males . Rural mothers were less educated . Fertility was 4 children / woman in rural areas , 3.4 children / woman in provincial capitals , and 2.8 children / woman in the capital city . Over 60 % of mothers were unemployed , and 76.5 % of mothers were unemployed in rural areas . Rural mothers received lower salaries . About 50 % had electricity in their homes . Almost 95 % of the rural population lived in single rooms , portable tents made of felt . 31.3 % lived in tents in the capital city . Hot and cold running water was available to 50 % in the central city and to 19.1 % in provincial capitals . Higher socioeconomic status was associated with lower infant and child mortality . There was a wide range in mortality levels by maternal salary . Infant and child mortality was lower in households that had consumer goods . The number of cows owned by the household was unrelated to child survival . 90 % of Mongolian women were literate . The educational status of the mother had the strongest and most significant effect on the level of infant and child mortality . The level of infant and child mortality was still too high for all educational groups . Mortality was high for infants and children living in tents . Findings suggest that early-age mortality in Mongolia is not consistent with the level of social development . Access to health care and quality of health care may be key reasons for this disparity . 	1996	1996-10-01	Mongolian journal of demography : journal of Population Teaching and Research Center / National University of Mongolia = Mongolyn khuÃán am zuÃáƒ≠n sƒótguÃáuÃál / Mongol uÃálsyn ikh suÃárguÃáuÃáliƒ≠n khuÃán am zuÃáƒ≠n suÃárgalt sudalgaany teviƒ≠n sƒótguÃ	Bayasgalan,B,B;	-1.23763

This paper presents demographic and socioeconomic findings from the 1994 Demographic Survey in Mongolia . Mongolia experienced a population tripling during 1950-90 . Almost 33 % of total population lived in the three major cities . Rural population was spread out across the countryside and along the river valleys . Mongolia shifted to a market economy in 1989 . Mongolia has had a pro-natalist population policy , but fertility began to decline during the 1970s . Mortality declined over time , but maternal mortality remained high at 10.1 / 10,000 live births in 1994 . Most households were headed by men ; 8 % were headed by females . Female-headed households were more common in the capital city . Average household size was 5.3 members . It is suggested that household size was slightly smaller in rural areas due to the availability of tent housing and land . The median age was 19.2 years . The sex ratio was 91 males to 100 females . The proportion of the population aged under 15 years appears to be declining . 43 % of women and only 23 % of men aged 20-24 years were currently married . Over 62 % of women and only 31 % of men aged over 65 years were widowed . 12 % of males and 10 % of females , and 17 % of males and 13 % of females in remote rural areas , never attended school . 20 % of males and 18 % of females attended primary school . 41 % of males and 44 % of females attended secondary school . Women were better educated and had higher enrollment than men . Almost 70 % of children aged 6-15 years were currently enrolled in school . Those living in the capital city were more likely to watch television than read a newspaper . Those living in rural areas were more likely to listen to the radio . People in Hentii and Hovd Aimag were least exposed to mass media . About 50 % of households perceived their level of income as adequate . People living in rural areas felt better off .

ERROR 12116718: 12292309	Projection of population of Mongolia . 	Several different scenarios are used to project population for Mongolia during 1989-99 and during 1999-2019 . The author states that the most important determinant of future population size and structure is fertility , followed by mortality . Mongolia is expected to have a population in the year 2019 ranging from 2.97 million to 3.07 million , depending upon the assumptions made . Total population in 1995 was 2.34 million . Population density is one of the lowest in the world . The crude death rate , beginning with the 1960s , showed the most significant decline from 12.3 to 7.3 . Life expectancy at birth has made only modest gains over the past 25 years . Mortality is extremely high for infants and children . Mortality during the adult years is high for women and low for men . The most significant feature of fertility decline since 1989 is the abortion rate , which was 62.9 / 1000 women and 511.5 / 1000 births . The size of the population at the turn of the century is expected to be under 2.5 million . Major changes will take place in the future age structure of population . There will be an increased proportion of population aged 15-64 years and a decline in the proportion of people of younger age . The most probable scenario assumes a modified exponential trend to mortality and a linear change in fertility from 2.3 children / woman in 1999 to 1.92 in 2019 . The annual growth in the labor force is expected to be 3.28 % annually until the first decades after the year 2000 , when growth will slow to 2.6 % annually . Population growth will be 1.2 % . The proportion not in the labor force will decline from 32.2 % to 28.1 % during 1989-2019 . The impact of future population size on education is also estimated by educational level , enrollment rate , teachers , and classrooms . 	1996	1996-10-01	Mongolian journal of demography : journal of Population Teaching and Research Center / National University of Mongolia = Mongolyn khuÃán am zuÃáƒ≠n sƒótguÃáuÃál / Mongol uÃálsyn ikh suÃárguÃáuÃáliƒ≠n khuÃán am zuÃáƒ≠n suÃárgalt sudalgaany teviƒ≠n sƒótguÃ	Gankhuyag,D,D;	-1.42253

This paper describes trends in urbanization in Mongolia , identifies major factors that affect the process of urbanization , and measures the effects of urbanization and population distribution on socioeconomic development . The analysis relies on census data for 1969 , 1979 , and 1989 . At independence , in 1911 , Mongolia had only one city , the capital city . Urban growth did not begin in a major way until the 1950s . Mongolia is currently divided into 21 administrative units : 18 provinces and 2 autonomous cities . Each province has a capital . There are also rural districts with administrative centers . By 1989 , all provinces had over 10,000 population . About 50 % of the population is now urban . Each of the three major cities has over 50,000 population . Population growth in urban areas during 1969-89 was three times the rate in rural areas , but the pace of growth slowed during 1979-89 . Housing is typically formal government housing or the traditional felt tent . Tent encampments surrounding major cities are similar to shantytowns in other developing countries . Occupants of tents have gainful employment , and the municipal government regulates the rent-free land and plot layouts . Only the capital city had population over 100,000 . Only one city in 1969 had population between 20,000 and 50,000 . In 1989 there were 19 cities with this population size . Most were centers in provinces . Population living in cities of 20,000 to 100,000 rose from 4.4 % of total urban population in 1969 to 31.7 % in 1989 . Urban population living in cities with under 20,000 people declined during this period from 44.9 % to 21.3 % . Population declined only slightly in the capital city , where in-migration accounted for 25 % of growth . Small urban places grew due to expansion of production activities in collectives . Policy decisions of the government were the most influential in influencing population distribution . 	1996	1996-10-01	Mongolian journal of demography : journal of Population Teaching and Research Center / National University of Mongolia = Mongolyn khuÃán am zuÃáƒ≠n sƒótguÃáuÃál / Mongol uÃálsyn ikh suÃárguÃáuÃáliƒ≠n khuÃán am zuÃáƒ≠n suÃárgalt sudalgaany teviƒ≠n sƒótguÃ	Batbileg,S,S;	-1.18828

The Center was established in 1990 in order to develop skills in the field of population at the national and local levels and to implement research that would help the government develop population plans and policies . Population education is directed to students full-time and part-time , to teachers , researchers , and government officials . The student program includes 2 years of general studies and 2 years of population studies . The curricula expose students to multidisciplinary studies of demography that include sociological , economic , cultural , and political factors . The degree program aims to prepare students to analyze population data with the use of computers . Since most of the international demographic literature is in English , the Center teaches the English language and tries to provide Mongolian translations of the English demographic literature . Two books on demography are currently available in Mongolian . The curricula include specialized modules on women in development , development planning , research methods , and population issues in Mongolia . Short-term training courses are now available to any organization in Mongolia . The research unit conducted a demographic survey in Mongolia during 1994 and 1996 . The Mongolian Journal of Demography is produced by the Center . The first issue is now available . The Center includes a Population Reference Unit and Computer Center . The population database POPLINE is available on compact disc . The Computer Center offers use of 10 personal computers , the latest software packages , and key UN software packages . Students are exposed to intensive modules on the use of SPSS in data analysis .

Walker-Warburg syndrome is an autosomal recessive developmental disorder characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy and complex brain and eye abnormalities . A similar combination of symptoms is presented by two other human diseases , muscle-eye-brain disease and Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy . Although the genes underlying FCMD and MEB have been cloned , loci for WWS have remained elusive . The protein products of POMGnT1 and Fukutin have both been implicated in protein glycosylation . To unravel the genetic basis of WWS , we first performed a genomewide linkage analysis in 10 consanguineous families with WWS . The results indicated the existence of at least three WWS loci . Subsequently , we adopted a candidate-gene approach in combination with homozygosity mapping in 15 consanguineous families with WWS . Candidate genes were selected on the basis of the role of the FCMD and MEB genes . Since POMGnT1 encodes an O-mannoside N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase , we analyzed the possible implication of O-mannosyl glycan synthesis in WWS . Analysis of the locus for O-mannosyltransferase 1 revealed homozygosity in 5 of 15 families . Sequencing of the POMT1 gene revealed mutations in 6 of the 30 unrelated patients with WWS . Of the five mutations identified , two are nonsense mutations , two are frameshift mutations , and one is a missense mutation . Immunohistochemical analysis of muscle from patients with POMT1 mutations corroborated the O-mannosylation defect , as judged by the absence of glycosylation of alpha-dystroglycan . The implication of O-mannosylation in MEB and WWS suggests new lines of study in understanding the molecular basis of neuronal migration . 	2002	2002-10-09	American journal of human genetics;2002 Nov;71;5;1033-43;	Beltr√°n-Valero de Bernab√©,Daniel,D;Currier,Sophie,S;Steinbrecher,Alice,A;Celli,Jacopo,J;van Beusekom,Ellen,E;van der Zwaag,Bert,B;Kayserili,H√ºlya,H;Merlini,Luciano,L;Chitayat,David,D;Dobyns,William B,WB;Cormand,Bru,B;Lehesjoki,Ana-Elina,AE;Cruces,Jes√	-0.76672

OBJECTIVE : Differentiation of geriatric major depression from Alzheimer &apos; s disease is hampered by overlapping symptoms . Increased CSF concentrations of tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 231 have been suggested as a biomarker for Alzheimer &apos; s disease .

This study evaluated the dietary pattern of foods and nutrients according to levels of vigorous leisure time physical activity assessed at recruitment within the Spanish cohort of the European Prospective Investigation on Cancer study . We used a validated PA questionnaire to measure the weekly frequency and duration of different kinds of sport activities . For dietary assessment , we used a validated diet history questionnaire that included all items consumed with a frequency of at least twice a month . We tested differences in food and nutrient intake according to PA duration by means of both an analysis of variance and an analysis of covariance adjusted for confounding factors . Linear increases or decreases in food and nutrient intake across PA levels were tested by means of a regression analysis . Only 11 % of men and 6 % of women performed at least 3 hours / week of intense PA , which is similar to current recommendations . Overall , main nutrient and total energy intakes were similar across different PA levels . However , the intake of some foods and vitamins did significantly increase as PA increased . The average gender-weighted percentage change in the intake of food and vitamins increased when moving from the lowest levels of PA to the highest . There was an increase in the intake of the following : 15.9 % in vegetables , 6.7 % in fruit , 9 % in fish , 5.6 % in dairy products , 10 % in vitamin C , 5.9 % in vitamin E , 7.2 % in retinol , 19.7 % in total carotene , 40.1 % in alpha-carotene , 20.4 % in beta-carotene , 11.2 % in licopene , and 26.1 % in lutein . BMI , which was above average for the cohort , decreased steadily when PA increased . To sum up , in this large Spanish cohort , the differences in dietary intake relative to levels of PA were not found either in the amount of total energy consumed nor in the number of main macronutrients but rather in the intake of certain foods which , while having very little or moderate caloric content , are very rich in highly bioactive elements such as vitamins and provitamins . 	2003	2003-03-28	International journal of sport nutrition and exercise metabolism;2003 Mar;13;1;47-64;	Tormo,Maria Jos√©,MJ;Navarro,Carmen,C;Chirlaque,Maria-Dolores,MD;Barber,Xavier,X;Argilaga,Silvia,S;Agudo,Antonio,A;Amiano,Pilar,P;Barricarte,Aurelio,A;Beguiristain,Jose M,JM;Dorronsoro,Miren,M;Gonzalez,Carlos Alberto,CA;Mart&apos;nez,Carmen,C;Quiros,Jos√	-1.6823

In most cases the 2 B-cell subsets displayed either different surface immunoglobulin light chain or different levels of the same sIg , usually associated with other phenotypic differences . Compared with monoclonal cases , B-CLL patients with 2 or more clones had lower white blood cell and lymphocyte counts , more frequently displayed splenomegaly , and required early treatment . Among these , the cases in which a CLL clone coexisted with a non-CLL clone were older and more often displayed B symptoms , a monoclonal component , and diffuse infiltration of bone marrow and required early treatment more frequently than cases with monoclonal CLL or 2 CLL clones . 	2003	2003-06-28	Blood;2003 Oct 15;102;8;2994-3002;	Sanchez,Maria-Luz,ML;Almeida,Julia,J;Gonzalez,David,D;Gonzalez,Marcos,M;Garcia-Marcos,Maria-Antonia,MA;Balanzategui,Ana,A;Lopez-Berges,Maria-Consuelo,MC;Nomdedeu,Josep,J;Vallespi,Teresa,T;Barbon,Marcos,M;Martin,Alejandro,A;de la Fuente,Pilar,P;Martin-Nu√	-1.08912
ERROR 12626520: 12872351	Outcome predictors of 84 patients with hematologic malignancies and Fusarium infection . 	BACKGROUND : Invasive infection by Fusarium sp. is associated with high mortality in patients with hematologic cancer . Yet to the authors &apos; knowledge , little is known regarding predictors of adverse outcome . METHODS : The authors conducted a retrospective review of the records of patients with hematologic carcinoma and invasive fusariosis who were treated at one institution in the U.S. and at 11 centers in Brazil . RESULTS : The records of 84 patients were evaluated . Neutropenia was present in 83 % and 33 patients had undergone stem cell transplantation . Only 18 patients were alive 90 days after the diagnosis of fusariosis . Multivariate predictors of poor outcome were persistent neutropenia and use of corticosteroids . The actuarial survival rate of patients without any of these factors was 67 % compared with 30 % for patients who recovered from neutropenia but were receiving corticosteroids and 4 % for patients with persistent neutropenia only . None of the patients with both risk factors survived . CONCLUSIONS : Measures to reduce the duration of neutropenia , as well as the judicious use of corticosteroids , may reduce the high mortality rate of fusariosis in patients with hematologic cancer . 	2003	2003-07-23	Cancer;2003 Jul 15;98;2;315-9;	Nucci,Marcio,M;Anaissie,Elias J,EJ;Queiroz-Telles,Flavio,F;Martins,Carlos A,CA;Trabasso,Pl√≠nio,P;Solza,Cristiana,C;Mangini,Claudia,C;Sim√µes,Belinda P,BP;Colombo,Arnaldo L,AL;Vaz,Jorge,J;Levy,Carlos E,CE;Costa,Silvia,S;Moreira,Vaneusa A,VA;Oliveira,Jos√	-1.18576

AIM : In contrast to other countries , no collective study of Rehbein &apos; s procedure in German-speaking nations has been performed . Therefore , our intention was , analogously to Goto and Ikeda &apos; s Japanese study in 1984 , Kleinhaus &apos; s study on Swenson &apos; s procedure in 1979 , Bourdelat &apos; s French-Canadian investigation into Duhamel &apos; s technique in 1997 and Martuciello &apos; s and Teitelbaum &apos; s follow-up in the year 2000 , to perform a follow-up study of Rehbein &apos; s technique of deep anterior resection . METHODS : The data of 200 patients from 22 German-speaking centers in Switzerland , Austria and Germany were collected . These data were gathered by questionnaire and the children were followed up in the individual participating hospitals for at least 3.5 years after the procedure . The procedure was performed between 1993 and 1997 , over a 5-year period . The questionnaire contained 74 items including anamnestic data , diagnostic postoperative treatment and reoperations . RESULTS : Concerning the incidence of anastomotic leaks and resolving anastomotic strictures there was no significant difference between the results in our series and those of the collective analyses made by Hofmann von Kap-herr , Holschneider and Sherman . In 6.6 % of the 191 patients an anastomotic leak and in 9.9 % a rectal stricture , which had to be dilated , was observed . Concerning late complications , 22.8 % of the children suffered from constipation , 4.3 % from encopresis , 10.6 % from enterocolitis and only 0.5 % from enuresis . The frequency of constipation diminishes over the years . A comparison of the different large series in the literature clearly shows that the incidence of constipation is higher after Rehbein &apos; s procedure and the frequency of urinary incontinence and encopresis higher following Swenson &apos; s , Soave &apos; s and Duhamel &apos; s techniques . The incidence of enterocolitis is less after Rehbein &apos; s procedure than after Swenson &apos; s , Soave &apos; s and Duhamel &apos; s techniques . CONCLUSIONS : The different results in the literature are due to the individual experience of the author , the very different follow-up methods and the date of follow-up . Therefore , the different results are hard to compare with our study . Nevertheless , Rehbein &apos; s anterior resection still could be presented as an adequate and important method to treat Hirschsprung &apos; s disease . 	2003	2003-08-27	European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

ERROR 14268946: 14532918	. 	AIM : The most accepted treatment for infection by Helicobacter pylori is the proton pump inhibitor based therapy with two antibiotics . However , there is no consensus regarding the duration . The purpose here was to compare eradication percentages in the omeprazole+amoxicillin+clarithromycin regimen administered during 7 days versus 10 days and confront the results with a previous 14-day* experience in Peru . METHOD : Patients from the Central Military Hospital and Peruvian-Japanese Hospital evidencing chronic upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms were recruited . We excluded patients with peptic ulcer . Biopsies were taken for diagnosis , for urease and PCR tests , culture and coloring with silver . Omeprazole+clarithromycin+amoxicillin was used during 7 days versus 10 days . Control endoscopy was performed one month after treatment had been completed and molecular biology techniques were used to differentiate recurrences from new infections . Susceptibility to clarithromycin was assessed . RESULTS : 36 patients were included in each group . Eradication was the same in both groups : 86.1 % . In several patients in whom the bacteria persisted , the same initial nucleus was found . In a previous study* using this same regimen during 14 days , a 93 % eradication was obtained . 91.18 % of our samples were susceptible to clarithromycin . CONCLUSIONS : In Peru , the omeprazole+clarithromycin+amoxicillin combination gives results higher than 80 % in the eradication of infection by Helicobacter pylori .

ERROR 14288427: 14569098	A cluster of mutations in the UMOD gene causes familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy with abnormal expression of uromodulin . 	Familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by abnormal tubular handling of urate and late development of chronic interstitial nephritis leading to progressive renal failure . A locus for FJHN was previously identified on chromosome 16p12 close to the MCKD2 locus , which is responsible for a variety of autosomal-dominant medullary cystic kidney disease . UMOD , the gene encoding the Tamm-Horsfall / uromodulin protein , maps within the FJHN / MCKD2 critical region . Mutations in UMOD were recently reported in nine families with FJHN / MCKD2 disease . A mutation in UMOD has been identified in 11 FJHN families -10 of which are novel-clustering in the highly conserved exon 4 . The consequences of UMOD mutations on uromodulin expression were investigated in urine samples and renal biopsies from nine patients in four families . There was a markedly increased expression of uromodulin in a cluster of tubule profiles , suggesting an accumulation of the protein in tubular cells . Consistent with this observation , urinary excretion of wild-type uromodulin was significantly decreased . The latter findings were not observed in patients with FJHN without UMOD mutations . In conclusion , this study points to a mutation clustering in exon 4 of UMOD as a major genetic defect in FJHN . Mutations in UMOD may critically affect the function of uromodulin , resulting in abnormal accumulation within tubular cells and reduced urinary excretion . 	2003	2003-10-22	Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN;2003 Nov;14;11;2883-93;	Dahan,Karin,K;Devuyst,Olivier,O;Smaers,Mich√®le,M;Vertommen,Didier,D;Loute,Guy,G;Poux,Jean-Michel,JM;Viron,B√©atrice,B;Jacquot,Christian,C;Gagnadoux,Marie-France,MF;Chauveau,Dominique,D;B√ºchler,Mathias,M;Cochat,Pierre,P;Cosyns,Jean-Pierre,JP;Mougenot,B√	-1.00923

ERROR 14695597: 14998450	. 	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : More information is needed on hypertension control in clinical practice , which includes taking at least two blood pressure readings and taking into account surgery times and previous antihypertensive drug intake . Our study aimed to assess the optimum degree of BP control in a broad sample of Spanish hypertensive patients in primary care and to determine factors associated with a poor control . PATIENTS AND METHOD : Cross-sectional , multicenter study of hypertensive patients aged over 18 years and treated with drugs during the preceeding three months , who were recruited by general practitioners through consecutive sampling in primary care settings throughout Spain over 3 consecutive days . BP measurements were performed in surgery hours following standardized methods and averaging two consecutive readings . An average BP lower than 140 / 90 mm Hg was regarded as optimum BP control . RESULTS : 12 754 patients were included , mean age 63.3 years , 57.2 % women . 36.1 % had good systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure controls , 39.1 % had good SBP control only , and 73.1 % had good DBP control only . BP control was significantly better during evening than during morning measurements and in patients who had taken antihypertensive treatment before measurement vs. those who had not taken it . Factors such as alcohol consumption , sedentary lifestyle , obesity and age were all associated with poor BP control CONCLUSIONS : The results of the PRESCAP 2002 study indicate that approximately 4 out of 10 hypertensive patients treated pharmacologically by primary health care centers in Spain have optimal BP control .

Kinins , a special class of polypeptides , are represented by bradykinin , kallidin , as well as their metabolites . The biological actions of these polypeptides binding on their receptors have been related to inflammation process , cytokines action , glutamate release and prostaglandins production . Usually , kinin B1 receptor is not expressed at a significant level under physiologic conditions in most tissues , but its expression is induced by injury , or upon exposure in vivo or in vitro to pro-inflammatory mediators . The kinin B2 receptor subtype is constitutively and widely expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system . These data raise the possibility for de novo expression of those receptors during the temporal lobe epilepsy , which has been related to cell death , gliosis and hippocampal reorganization . To correlate kinin system and TLE , adult male Wistar rats were submitted to pilocarpine model of epilepsy . The hippocampi were removed 6 h , 5 and 60 days after status epilepticus onset . The collected tissues were used to study the expression of kinin B1 and B2 mRNA receptors , using Real-Time PCR .

Acquisition of CCR7 expression is an important phenotype change during dendritic cell maturation that endows these cells with the capability to migrate to lymph nodes . We have analyzed the possible role of CCR7 on the regulation of the survival of DCs . Stimulation with CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21 inhibits apoptotic hallmarks of serum-deprived DCs , including membrane phosphatidylserine exposure , loss of mitochondria membrane potential , increased membrane blebs , and nuclear changes . Both chemokines induced a rapid activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 &apos; -kinase / Akt1 , with a prolonged and persistent activation of Akt1 . Interference with PI3K , Gi , or G protein betagamma subunits abrogated the effects of the chemokines on Akt1 activation and on survival . In contrast , inhibition of extracellular signal-related kinase 1 / 2 , p38 , or c-Jun N-terminal kinase was ineffective . Nuclear factor-kappaB was involved in the antiapoptotic effects of chemokines because inhibition of NFkappaB blunted the effects of CCL19 and CCL21 on survival . Furthermore , chemokines induced down-regulation of the NFkappaB inhibitor IkappaB , an increase of NFkappaB DNA-binding capability , and translocation of the NFkappaB subunit p65 to the nucleus . In summary , in addition to its well-established role in chemotaxis , we show that CCR7 also induces antiapoptotic signaling in mature DCs . 	2004	2004-04-03	Blood;2004 Aug 1;104;3;619-25;	S√°nchez-S√°nchez,Noelia,N;Riol-Blanco,Lorena,L;de la Rosa,Gonzalo,G;Puig-Kr√∂ger,Amaya,A;Garc√≠a-Bordas,Julio,J;Mart√≠n,Daniel,D;Longo,Natividad,N;Cuadrado,Antonio,A;Caba√±as,Carlos,C;Corb√≠,Angel L,AL;S√°nchez-Mateos,Paloma,P;Rodr√≠guez-Fern√°ndez,Jos√	-0.303729

OBJECTIVES : Three recently identified NOD2 / CARD15 mutations have been described associated with an increased susceptibility Crohn &apos; s disease . Our aim was to examine the potential association of these NOD2 mutations with CD and different subsets of CD phenotypes in our population . METHODS : Two hundred and five well-defined CD patients from north-western France and 95 ethnically matched healthy controls were genotyped for mutations R702W , G908R and Leu1007insC by DNA sequencing . Allele and genotype frequencies of NOD2 variants were examined in the whole series of CD and in different subgroups of CD phenotypes defined by the clinical characteristics of the Vienna classification or by histological features . RESULTS : Carriers of at least one NOD2 / CARD15 variant were significantly more frequent in CD than in controls , and the R702W allele was the most significant contributor to this NOD2 association with CD . Homozygotes and compound heterozygotes combined had a higher risk of CD than simple heterozygotes for any variant compared with subjects with no variant . Univariate analysis revealed that carriage of at least one NOD2 mutation was significantly associated with ileal involvement , and stricturing evolution . Granuloma was associated with an excess of the R702W allele , and was correlated with a young age at diagnosis , whatever the NOD2 / CARD15 genotype . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that carriage of NOD2 / CARD15 mutants , especially R702W , was primarily and independently associated both with stricturing evolution of CD and the presence of granuloma . CONCLUSIONS : In our population , all NOD2 / CARD15 mutant genotypes , especially compound heterozygosity , were found to increase the risk of CD , but R702W was the sole allele showing a significant association with CD . In addition , we confirm the positive and independent association of the R702W mutation with stricturing behaviour and describe a second one with the presence of granuloma . 	2004	2004-04-21	European journal of gastroenterology &amp; hepatology;2004 Jan;16;1;55-62;	Heresbach,Denis,D;Gicquel-Douabin,V√©ronique,V;Birebent,Brigitte,B;D&apos;halluin,Pierre-Nicolas,PN;Heresbach-Le Berre,Nathalie,N;Dreano,St√©phane,S;Siproudhis,Laurent,L;Dabadie,Alain,A;Gosselin,Michel,M;Mosser,Jean,J;Semana,Gilbert,G;Bretagne,Jean-Fran√	-1.08356

DESIGN : A 25-d intervention study with complete control of dietary intake was performed in 43 healthy male and female nonsmokers who were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups . In addition to a basic diet devoid of fruit and vegetables , the fruit and vegetables group received 600 g fruit and vegetables / d ; the placebo group received a placebo pill , and the supplement group received a vitamin pill designed to contain vitamins and minerals corresponding to those in 600 g fruit and vegetables . Biomarkers of oxidative damage to protein and lipids and of antioxidant nutrients and defense enzymes were determined before and during intervention . RESULTS : Plasma lipid oxidation lag times increased during intervention in the Fruveg and supplement groups , and the increase was significantly higher in the former . Plasma protein carbonyl formation at lysine residues also increased in both of these groups . Glutathione peroxidase activity increased in the Fruveg group only . Other markers of oxidative damage , oxidative capacity , or antioxidant defense were largely unaffected by the intervention . CONCLUSIONS : Fruit and vegetables increase erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase activity and resistance of plasma lipoproteins to oxidation more efficiently than do the vitamins and minerals that fruit and vegetables are known to contain . Plasma protein carbonyl formation at lysine residues increases because of the vitamins and minerals in fruit and vegetables . 	2004	2004-05-26	The American journal of clinical nutrition;2004 Jun;79;6;1060-72;	Dragsted,Lars O,LO;Pedersen,Anette,A;Hermetter,Albin,A;Basu,Samar,S;Hansen,Max,M;Haren,Gitte R,GR;Kall,Morten,M;Breinholt,Vibeke,V;Castenmiller,Jacqueline J M,JJ;Stagsted,Jan,J;Jakobsen,Jette,J;Skibsted,Leif,L;Rasmussen,Salka E,SE;Loft,Steffen,S;Sandstr√	-1.18509

METHOD : The data were collected through a previously designed questionnaire . Apart from epidemiological information , the form includes the disease to prescribe this treatment , the specific nutritional treatment used and its duration , access path , complications and readmission rate in hospital , follow-up of the treatment , and progress . All data were processed and analysed by the co-ordinating team . RESULTS : Seventeen hospitals participated , and 66 patients were enrolled . Middle age was 5.5 +/- 4.9 years for patients &lt; 14 years old , and 49.2 +/- 15.8 years for those &gt; or = 14 years old . The more prevalent diagnosis were : ischemic bowel , neoplasm , radiation enteritis , motility disorders and Crohn &apos; s disease . The mean time on HPN was 8.4 +/- 4.5 months . Tunnelled catheter was the preferential route , followed by the implantated one . The intermittent method was preferential . Patients receive the formula , mainly from hospital pharmacy . The complications related to nutrition included the infections , mechanic , metabolic and electrolytic disorders . The readmission rate , for nutritional problems , was 1.34 / patient . At the end of the year , 74.2 % of the patients remained in the HPN program , and 25.8 % abandoned the treatment CONCLUSIONS : This review illustrates that the registration of HPN patients in our country is standing , that vascular pathology is the more frequent diagnoses in HPN patients , and the rate of readmission and complications and the behaviour is similar to other series making this as a safe treatment in our place . 	2004	2004-06-24	Nutrici√≥n hospitalaria : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espa√±ola de Nutrici√≥n Parenteral y Enteral;2004 May-Jun;19;3;139-43;	Planas,M,M;Castell√†,M,M;Moreno,J M,JM;Pita,A M,AM;Pedr√≥n,C,C;G√≥mez Candela,C,C;G√≥mez Enterr√≠a,P,P;de la Cuerda,C,C;P√©rez de la Cruz,A,A;Forga,M T,MT;Mart√≠,E,E;Garde,C,C;Carrera,J A,JA;Garc√≠a Luna,P P,PP;Ord√≥√±ez,J,J;Bonada,A,A;Pares,R M,RM;Rodr√	-1.28558
ERROR 14895793: 15213566	Effect of mycophenolate mofetil on immune response and plasma and lymphatic tissue viral load during and after interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy for patients with chronic HIV infection : a randomized pilot study . 	The main goal of this study was to assess the role of mycophenolate mofetil during interruption of highly active antiretroviral therapy . Seventeen patients with early-stage chronic HIV type 1 infection were treated with HAART for 12 months . They were then randomized to receive MMF or to continue the regimen for 120 additional days . At day 120 in the HAART-MMF group , HAART was discontinued , and MMF administration was continued . The primary end point of the study was the number of individuals maintaining a plasma viral load set point of &lt; 200 copies / mL after at least 6 months off HAART . At day 120 , all patients in both groups had undetectable plasma VLs . After 6 months off HAART , 5 of 9 patients in the HAART-MMF group versus 1 of 6 patients in the HAART group maintained a plasma VL of &lt; 200 copies / mL . According to the ability of their plasma to inhibit cellular proliferation , patients were reclassified and divided into an inhibition group and a no inhibition group . The doubling time of VL rebound was significantly higher in the inhibition group than in the no inhibition group . Moreover , 5 of 6 patients in the inhibition group maintained a plasma VL of &lt; 200 copies / mL versus 1 of 9 patients in the no inhibition group after 6 months off HAART . We found that combining MMF and HAART delayed VL rebound and improved control of viral replication without HAART but only when inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation was achieved . 	2004	2004-06-24	Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999);2004 Jul 1;36;3;823-30;	Garc√≠a,Felipe,F;Plana,Montserrat,M;Arnedo,Mireia,M;Brunet,Mer√ße,M;Castro,Pedro,P;Gil,Cristina,C;Vidal,Elena,E;Mill√°n,Olga,O;L√≥pez,Anna,A;Martorell,Jaume,J;Fumero,Emilio,E;Mir√≥,Jos√© M,JM;Alcam√≠,Jos√©,J;Pumarola,Tom√°s,T;Gallart,Teresa,T;Gatell,Jos√	-1.27729
ERROR 14911916: 15230667	Predictors of response to infliximab in patients with fistulizing Crohn &apos; s disease . 	OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of infliximab for the treatment of fistulizing Crohn &apos; s disease . METHODS : Consecutive patients with fistulizing Crohn &apos; s disease receiving infliximab were prospectively enrolled . Partial response was defined as a reduction of 50 % or more from base-line in the number of draining fistulae . Complete response was defined as the closure of all fistulae . The influence of different variables on the efficacy of infliximab was evaluated . RESULTS : 108 patients were included . The disease was inflammatory plus fistulizing in 18 % and only fistulizing in 82 % . After the third infusion of infliximab the response was partial in 26 % and complete in 57 % . Response rates depending on fistula location were : enterocutaneous , perianal , rectovaginal , and enterovesical . None of the studied variables correlated with efficacy of infliximab in the multivariate analysis . Incidence of adverse effects depending on the dose of infliximab was : first dose , second , and third . CONCLUSIONS : Infliximab is an efficacious treatment for fistulizing Crohn &apos; s disease . Partial response was achieved in approximately one third of the patients , and complete response in more than half . No studied variable was predictive of response . Adverse effects were relatively infrequent and mild . 	2004	2004-07-03	Revista espa√±ola de enfermedades digestivas : organo oficial de la Sociedad Espa√±ola de Patolog√≠a Digestiva;2004 Jun;96;6;379-81; 382-4;	Luna-Chadid,M,M;P√©rez Calle,J L,JL;Mendoza,J L,JL;Vera,M I,MI;Bermejo,A F,AF;S√°nchez,F,F;L√≥pez San Rom√°n,A,A;Froil√°n,C,C;Gonz√°lez-Lara,V,V;Garc√≠a-Paredes,J,J;Fern√°ndez-Blanco,I,I;Abreu,L,L;Casis,B,B;Sol√≠s Herruzo,J A,JA;Gisbert,J P,JP;Mat√© Jim√	-1.38096

Alzheimer &apos; s disease is characterized by a substantial degeneration of pyramidal neurons and the appearance of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles . Here we present a novel transgenic mouse model , APPPS1KI that closely mimics the development of AD-related neuropathological features including a significant hippocampal neuronal loss . This transgenic mouse model carries M233T / L235P knocked-in mutations in presenilin-1 and overexpresses mutated human beta-amyloid precursor protein . Abeta is the major form of Abeta species present in this model with progressive development of a complex pattern of N-truncated variants and dimers , similar to those observed in AD brain . At 10 months of age , an extensive neuronal loss is present in the CA1 / 2 hippocampal pyramidal cell layer that correlates with strong accumulation of intraneuronal Abeta and thioflavine-S-positive intracellular material but not with extracellular Abeta deposits . A strong reactive astrogliosis develops together with the neuronal loss . This loss is already detectable at 6 months of age and is PS1KI gene dosage-dependent . Thus , APPPS1KI mice further confirm the critical role of intraneuronal Abeta in neuronal loss and provide an excellent tool to investigate therapeutic strategies designed to prevent AD neurodegeneration . 	2004	2004-10-07	The American journal of pathology;2004 Oct;165;4;1289-300;	Casas,Caty,C;Sergeant,Nicolas,N;Itier,Jean-Michel,JM;Blanchard,V√©ronique,V;Wirths,Oliver,O;van der Kolk,Nicolien,N;Vingtdeux,Val√©rie,V;van de Steeg,Evita,E;Ret,Gwena√´lle,G;Canton,Thierry,T;Drobecq,Herv√©,H;Clark,Allan,A;Bonici,Bruno,B;Delacourte,Andr√	-0.486565

ERROR 15143117: 15474698	Therapeutic implications of in-stent restenosis located at the stent edge . Insights from the restenosis intra-stent balloon angioplasty versus elective stenting randomized trial . 	AIMS : In patients with in-stent restenosis several anatomic subgroups have been identified . ISR affecting the stent edge is a poorly characterised subgroup with undefined therapeutic implications . We sought to determine the implications of ISR affecting the stent EDG . METHODS AND RESULTS : 450 patients included in the &quot; Restenosis Intra-stent : Balloon angioplasty vs elective Stenting &quot; randomized study , were analysed . EDG ISR was predefined in the protocol and the pattern of ISR analysed in a centralized core-lab . Fifty-two patients had EDG ISR . Patients with EDG ISR had less severe and shorter lesions . Patients with EDG ISR more frequently required crossover but eventually the immediate angiographic result and the long-term clinical and angiographic outcome was similar to that found in patients without EDG ISR . Patients with EDG ISR treated in the balloon and stent arms had similar baseline characteristics . However , after intervention , the immediate angiographic result was better in the stent arm . This difference persisted at late follow-up : MLD , recurrent restenosis . In addition , the 1-year event-free survival was significantly better in the stent arm . Moreover , stent implantation was an independent predictor of freedom from target vessel revascularization . CONCLUSIONS : EDG ISR constitutes a specific subgroup with relevant therapeutic implications . In patients with EDG ISR , repeat stent implantation provides better clinical and angiographic outcome than conventional balloon angioplasty . 	2004	2004-10-12	European heart journal;2004 Oct;25;20;1829-35;	Alfonso,Fernando,F;Melgares,Rafael,R;Mainar,Vicente,V;Leza√∫n,Rom√°n,R;V√°zquez,Nicol√°s,N;Tasc√≥n,Juan,J;Pomar,Francisco,F;Cequier,Angel,A;Angel,Juan,J;P√©rez-Vizcayno,Mar√≠a-Jos√©,MJ;Sabat√©,Manel,M;Ba√±uelos,Camino,C;Fern√°ndez,Cristina,C;Garc√≠a,Jos√	-1.04202

BACKGROUND : Inhibition of the acyl coenzyme A : cholesterol acyltransferase enzyme may prevent excess accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages . The ACAT inhibitor avasimibe was shown to reduce experimental atherosclerosis . This study was designed to investigate the effects of avasimibe on human coronary atherosclerosis . METHODS AND RESULTS : This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial assessed the effects of avasimibe at dosages of 50 , 250 , and 750 mg QD on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by intravascular ultrasound . All patients received background lipid-lowering therapy if necessary to reach a target baseline LDL level &lt; 125 mg / dL . IVUS and coronary angiography were performed at baseline and repeated after up to 24 months of treatment . Approximately equal percentages of patients across groups received concurrent statin therapy . The mean total plaque volume at baseline was approximately 200 mm3 , and the least squares mean change at end of treatment was 0.7 mm3 for placebo and 7.7 , 4.1 , and 4.8 mm3 for the avasimibe 50 , 250 , and 750 mg groups , respectively . Percent atheroma volume increased by 0.4 % with placebo and by 0.7 % , 0.8 % , and 1.0 % in the respective avasimibe groups . LDL cholesterol increased during the study by 1.7 % with placebo but by 7.8 % , 9.1 % , and 10.9 % in the respective avasimibe groups .

ERROR 15245028: 15583274	Rapid detection of rifampin resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from India and Mexico by a molecular beacon assay . 	We assessed the performance of a rapid , single-well , real-time PCR assay for the detection of rifampin-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by using clinical isolates from north India and Mexico , regions with a high incidence of tuberculosis . The assay uses five differently colored molecular beacons to determine if a short region of the M. tuberculosis rpoB gene contains mutations that predict rifampin resistance in most isolates . Until now , the assay had not been sufficiently tested on samples from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis . In the present study , the assay detected mutations in 16 out of 16 rifampin-resistant isolates from north India and in 55 of 64 rifampin-resistant isolates from Mexico compared to results with standard susceptibility testing . The assay did not detect mutations in 37 out of 37 rifampin-susceptible isolates from India and 125 out of 126 rifampin-susceptible isolates from Mexico . DNA sequencing revealed that none of the nine rifampin-resistant isolates from Mexico , which were misidentified as rifampin susceptible by the molecular beacon assay , contained a mutation in the region targeted by the molecular beacons . The one rifampin-susceptible isolate from Mexico that appeared to be rifampin resistant by the molecular beacon assay contained an S531W mutation , which is usually associated with rifampin resistance . Of the rifampin-resistant isolates that were correctly identified in the molecular beacon assay , one contained a novel L530A mutation and another contained a novel deletion between codons 511 and 514 . Overall , the molecular beacon assay appears to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity for use in countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis . 	2004	2004-12-08	Journal of clinical microbiology;2004 Dec;42;12;5512-6;	Varma-Basil,Mandira,M;El-Hajj,Hiyam,H;Colangeli,Roberto,R;Hazb√≥n,Manzour Hernando,MH;Kumar,Sujeet,S;Bose,Mridula,M;Bobadilla-del-Valle,Miriam,M;Garc√≠a,Lourdes Garc√≠a,LG;Hern√°ndez,Araceli,A;Kramer,Fred Russell,FR;Osornio,Jose Sifuentes,JS;Ponce-de-Le√	-0.944342

OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency , characteristics and risk factors of lipid changes associated with lopinavir / ritonavir treatment in antiretroviral-naive patients . METHODS : A prospective cohort of 107 antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients was followed for 12 months after starting lopinavir / ritonavir-based highly active antiretroviral therapy . RESULTS : At 12 months , percentages of patients with hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia were 17.4 % and 40 % , respectively . Mean increases in total cholesterol and triglycerides were 40.7 and 73.3 mg / dL . There was a significant increase in both low-density and high-density cholesterol , and no increase in the total cholesterol / HDL ratio . Baseline cholesterol &gt; 200 mg / dL and triglycerides &gt; 150 mg / dL were independent risk factors for dyslipidaemia , while hepatitis C coinfection appeared to be protective . CONCLUSIONS : Patients with elevated lipid values at baseline have the greatest risk of developing hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia after starting lopinavir / ritonavir .

The most frequent mutations were I2 splice in the salt wasting form , I172N in the simple virilizing and V281L in the nonclassical form , presenting similar frequencies as those observed in other populations . We found a lower frequency of 21-hydroxylase gene deletion , similar to that previously identified in Argentinean and Mexican populations . Five new mutations were described in our population : G424S , H28+C , Ins 1003 1004 A , R408C and IVS2-2A &gt; G . The genotype was classified in three groups according to the impairment of enzymatic activity observed in vitro , Group A : 0-2 % , Group B : 3-7 % and Group C : &gt; 20 % . Group A mutations correlated with the salt wasting form , the Group B with simple virilizing form and Group C with the non classical form . The severity of genotype showed a positive correlation with higher 17OH-progesterone and testosterone levels . The I2 splice mutation in homo or hemizygosis confers classical form phenotype with both salt wasting and simple virilizing forms , precluding the prediction of the clinical form through genotype in pre and neonatal diagnosis . The good genotype-phenotype correlation in patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency shows the usefulness of genotype to predict the clinical form for genetic counseling , prenatal diagnosis and to confirm neonatal screening diagnosis , except in cases with I2 splice mutation . 	2005	2005-03-12	Arquivos brasileiros de endocrinologia e metabologia;2004 Oct;48;5;697-704;	Bachega,T√¢nia A S S,TA;Billerbeck,Ana Elisa C,AE;Parente,Erica B,EB;Lemos-Marini,Sofia H V,SH;Baptista,Maria Tereza M,MT;Mello,Maricilda P,MP;Guerra,Gil,G;Kuperman,Hilton,H;Setian,Nuvarte,N;Damiani,Durval,D;Torres,Nat√°lia,N;Castro,Margaret de,M;Mendon√	-0.939157

ERROR 15574686: 15937289	Guidelines for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia : predictors of adherence and outcome . 	RATIONALE : Some studies highlight the association of better clinical responses with adherence to guidelines for empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia , but little is known about factors that influence this adherence . OBJECTIVES : Our objectives were to identify factors influencing adherence to the guidelines for empiric treatment of CAP , and to evaluate the impact of adherence on outcome . METHODS : We studied 1,288 patients with CAP admitted to 13 Spanish hospitals . Collected variables included the patients &apos; clinical and demographic data , initial severity of the disease , antibiotic treatment , and specialty and training status of the prescribing physician . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : Adherence to guidelines was high , with significant differences between hospitals and physicians . The independent factors related to higher adherence were hospital , physician characteristics , and initial high-risk class of Fine , whereas admission to intensive care unit decreased adherence . Seventy-four patients died , and treatment failure was found in 175 patients . After adjusting for Fine risk class , adherence to the guidelines was found protective for mortality and for treatment failure . Treatment prescribed by pneumologists and residents was associated with lower treatment failure . CONCLUSIONS : Adherence to guidelines mainly depends on the hospital and the specialty and training status of prescribing physicians . Nonadherence was higher in nonpneumology specialists , and is an independent risk factor for treatment failure and mortality . 	2005	2005-06-07	American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine;2005 Sep 15;172;6;757-62;	Men√©ndez,Rosario,R;Torres,Antoni,A;Zalaca√≠n,Rafael,R;Aspa,Javier,J;Mart√≠n-Villasclaras,Juan J,JJ;Border√≠as,Luis,L;Ben√≠tez-Moya,Jos√© M,JM;Ruiz-Manzano,Juan,J;de Castro,Felipe Rodr√≠guez,FR;Blanquer,Jos√©,J;P√©rez,Diego,D;Puzo,Carmen,C;S√°nchez-Gasc√	-1.12694

Clone stability and in vitro phytoextraction capacity of vegetative clones of P. x canescens including two transgenic clones were studied as in vitro leaf disc cultures . Presence of the gshI-transgene in the transformed clones was detected in PCR reactions using gshI-specific primers . Clone stability was determined by fAFLP analysis . In total , 682 AFLP fragments were identified generated by twelve selective primer pairs after EcoRI-MseI digestion . Four fragments generated by EcoAGT-MseCCC were different which proves an unexpectedly low bud mutation frequency in P. x canescens . For the study of phytoextraction capacity leaf discs were exposed to a concentration series of ZnSO4 incubated for 21 days on aseptic tissue culture media WPM containing 1 microM Cu . Zn2+ caused phytotoxicity only at high concentrations . The transgenic poplar cyt-ECS clone , as stimulated by the presence of Zn , showed elevated heavy metal uptake as compared to the non-transformed clone .

It impairs health related quality of life . However , the impact on utility scores and work productivity in patients with moderate to severe GERD is not well known . METHODS : We analyzed data from 217 patients with moderate to severe GERD across 17 Canadian centers . Patients completed three utility instruments -- the standard gamble , the feeling thermometer , and the Health Utilities Index 3 -- and several HRQL instruments , including Quality of Life in Reflux and Dyspepsia and the Medical Outcomes Short Form-36 . All patients received a proton pump inhibitor , esomeprazole 40 mg daily , for four to six weeks . RESULTS : The mean scores on a scale from 0 to 1 obtained for the FT , SG , and HUI 3 were 0.67 , 0.76 , and 0.80 respectively . The mean scores on the SF-36 were lower than the previously reported Canadian and US general population mean scores and work productivity was impaired . CONCLUSION : GERD has significant impact on utility scores , HRQL , and work productivity in patients with moderate to severe disease . Furthermore , the FT and HUI 3 provide more valid measurements of HRQL in GERD than the SG .

ERROR 15691641: 16075130	. 	BACKGROUND : Ultraviolet light exposure has a pathogenic effect on the development of skin cancer , whose prevalence increases worldwide . In Chile and the rest of the world , preventive educational campaigns are carried out to change high risk sun exposure behaviors . AIM : To study the behavior of the Chilean population towards skin cancer prevention and to identify erroneous preventive practices and concepts . MATERIAL AND METHODS : A survey containing 17 questions about sun exposure behaviors , photoprotective measures and knowledge about ultraviolet radiation and skin cancer was used . It was applied during January and February 2004 , to 1,143 subjects , taking vacations in beach resorts in Chile . RESULTS : The hours of higher sun exposure ranged from 12 AM to 4 PM . Thirty seven percent of subjects were exposed more than 2 hours during this high risk lapse . Women and subjects aged less than 25 years were those with the riskiest behaviors . Fifty four percent used some type of photoprotection and 50 % used ocular protection . Seventy percent used creams with sun screen and 74 % used a sun protection factor higher than 15 . Seventy percent applied the sun screen as recommended . Thirty eight percent had at least one sun burn in the last two years . More than 90 % of subjects were aware of the relationship between sun exposure and skin cancer but 60 % did not know the hours of higher ultraviolet radiation . The information about sun exposure was obtained from television in 57 % of surveyed individuals .

ERROR 15714248: 16099293	Postoperative radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy : a randomised controlled trial . 	BACKGROUND : Local failure after prostatectomy can arise in patients with cancer extending beyond the capsule . We did a randomised controlled trial to compare radical prostatectomy followed by immediate external irradiation with prostatectomy alone for patients with positive surgical margin or pT3 prostate cancer . METHODS : After undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy , 503 patients were randomly assigned to a wait-and-see policy , and 502 to immediate postoperative radiotherapy . Eligible patients had pN0M0 tumours and one or more pathological risk factors : capsule perforation , positive surgical margins , invasion of seminal vesicles . Our revised primary endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival . Analysis was by intention to treat . FINDINGS : The median age was 65 years . After a median follow-up of 5 years , biochemical progression-free survival was significantly improved in the irradiated group . Clinical progression-free survival was also significantly improved . The cumulative rate of locoregional failure was significantly lower in the irradiated group . Grade 2 or 3 late effects were significantly more frequent in the postoperative irradiation group , but severe toxic toxicity were rare , with a 5-year rate of 2.6 % in the wait-and-see group and 4.2 % in the postoperative irradiation group . INTERPRETATION : Immediate external irradiation after radical prostatectomy improves biochemical progression-free survival and local control in patients with positive surgical margins or pT3 prostate cancer who are at high risk of progression .

Phase 2 studies suggest that the monoclonal antibody rituximab may improve the prognosis of patients with follicular lymphoma when it is added to chemotherapy . In the current study , 428 patients with untreated , advanced-stage FL were randomly assigned for therapy with cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone alone or CHOP combined with rituximab . R-CHOP reduced the relative risk for treatment failure by 60 % and significantly prolonged the time to treatment failure . In addition , a significantly higher overall response rate and a prolonged duration of remission were achieved . In spite of a relatively short observation time , these beneficial effects even translated to superior overall survival , with 6 deaths in the R-CHOP group compared with 17 deaths in the CHOP group within the first 3 years . The predominant treatment-related adverse effect was myelosuppression . Severe granulocytopenia was more frequently observed after R-CHOP . However , severe infections were rare and of similar frequency after R-CHOP and CHOP .

The transition from a green , hard , and acidic pericarp to a sweet , soft , coloured , and sugar-rich ripe fruit occurs in many unrelated fruit species . High throughput identification of differentially expressed genes in grape berry has been achieved by the use of 50-mers oligoarrays bearing a set of 3,200 Unigenes from Vitis vinifera to compare berry transcriptome at nine developmental stages . Analysis of transcript profiles revealed that most activations were triggered simultaneously with softening , occurring within only 24 h for an individual berry , just before any change in colouration or water , sugar , and acid content can be detected . Although most dramatically induced genes belong to unknown functional categories , numerous changes occur in the expression of isogenes involved in primary and secondary metabolism during ripening . Focusing on isogenes potentially significant in development regulation revealed a possible role for several hormones . Transcription factor analysis revealed the induction of RAP2 and WRKY genes at v√©raison , suggesting increasing biotic and abiotic stress conditions during ripening . This observation was strengthened by an increased expression of multiple transcripts involved in sugar metabolism and also described as induced in other plant organs during stress conditions . This approach permitted the identification of new isogenes as possible control points : a glutathione S-transferase exhibits the same expression profile as anthocyanin accumulation and a new putative sugar transporter is induced in parallel with sugar import . 	2005	2005-09-10	Planta;2005 Nov;222;5;832-47;	Terrier,Nancy,N;Glissant,David,D;Grimplet,J√©r√¥me,J;Barrieu,Fran√ßois,F;Abbal,Philippe,P;Couture,Carole,C;Ageorges,Agn√®s,A;Atanassova,Rossitza,R;L√©on,C√©line,C;Renaudin,Jean-Pierre,JP;D√©dald√©champ,Fabienne,F;Romieu,Charles,C;Delrot,Serge,S;Hamdi,Sa√	-1.77975

ERROR 15771313: 16160742	Prevalence of Paget &apos; s disease of bone in Italy . 	UNLABELLED : We examined the prevalence of PDB in Italy from radiological , scintigraphic , and biochemical surveys in two Italian towns . Prevalence rates varied from 0.7 % to 2.4 % , were higher in males than in females , and slightly differed between the two towns . Unlike previous studies in populations of British descent , no secular trend for a decreasing prevalence emerged . INTRODUCTION : Clinical , radiological , and necropsy data from different countries suggested pronounced geographical variations in the prevalence of Paget &apos; s disease of bone . Despite the impact of the disease on the population , there are limited data on the prevalence of PDB in Italy . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of PDB in the district of Siena and Turin from radiological , biochemical , and scintigraphic surveys . We examined a sample of 1778 consecutive pelvic radiographs performed between 1999 and 2000 at the Hospital Radiology Unit in Siena and 6609 pelvic radiographs performed in 1986-1987 , 1992-1993 , and 1999-2002 from the Radiology Department of Molinette Hospital in Turin . In Siena , 7906 consecutive TC-MDP bone scans performed over a 4-year period were also screened for the presence of PDB , and the prevalence of elevated alkaline phosphatase levels was estimated from 7449 computerized medical records over a 3-year period . The finding of PDB on the pelvic radiograph and bone scan was based on standardized radiological criteria . RESULTS : At the end of the radiological surveys , 16 / 1778 pelvic PDB cases were observed in Siena and 41 / 6609 in Turin . The crude prevalence of the disease was 0.89 % in Siena and 0.62 % in Turin . Given that pelvic involvement is commonly described in 60-90 % of PDB patients , the estimated overall prevalence of PDB ranged from 1.0 % to 1.5 % in Siena and from 0.7 % to 1.0 % in Turin . No decrease in the prevalence of PDB was evident after comparison of prevalence rates from different periods . Biochemical analyses showed 296 / 7449 subjects with elevated ALP levels and normal liver enzymes , 87 of whom had confirmed diagnosis of PDB . The estimated prevalence of biochemical PDB was 1.5 % . The scintigraphic survey showed a PDB prevalence of 194 / 7906 , which was significantly higher than the radiological and biochemical estimates . CONCLUSIONS : Our surveys suggest that PDB in Italy has an estimated prevalence of at least 1 % , comparable with that observed in United States and other European countries , but lower than that described in Britain and New Zealand . No secular trend for a decreasing prevalence of PDB was observed . 	2005	2005-09-15	Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research;2005 Oct;20;10;1845-50;	Gennari,Luigi,L;Di Stefano,Marco,M;Merlotti,Daniela,D;Giordano,Nicola,N;Martini,Giuseppe,G;Tamone,Cristina,C;Zatteri,Roberto,R;De Lucchi,Roberto,R;Baldi,Carlo,C;Vattimo,Angelo,A;Capoccia,Silvia,S;Burroni,Luca,L;Geraci,Simone,S;De Paola,Vincenzo,V;Calabr√	-1.20407

ERROR 15853003: 16248210	Role of PGL-I antibody detection in the diagnosis of pure neural leprosy . 	Pure neural leprosy is difficult to diagnose because skin lesions and acid-fast bacilli in slit smears are absent . At present , the gold standard for PNL diagnosis is the histopathological examination of a peripheral nerve biopsy . Even so , detection of bacteria is difficult and histological findings may be non-specific . Furthermore , nerve biopsy is an invasive procedure that is only possible in specialized centres . Therefore , there is a need for additional diagnostic methods that may help to confirm the clinical diagnosis of PNL . In the present study , an additional laboratory test , the ELISA for anti-phenolic glycolipid I IgM antibodies , was performed on 103 individuals with clinical and neurophysiological signs of peripheral neuropathy , of which 67 were diagnosed as PNL patients and 36 remained as &apos; not diagnosed as PNL &apos; , as well as on a control group of 34 patients with other neurological diseases . An antibody response was present in 14 / 67 of the patients diagnosed as PNL as compared with 3 / 34 of controls . Anti-PGL-I positivity was observed in 5 / 8 of the AFB positive cases . Patients whose diagnosis was confirmed solely by Mycobacterium leprae PCR on the nerve sample had 4 / 25 seropositivity . In addition , anti-PGL-I antibodies were detected in 9 / 40 of the PNL patients who were PCR negative for M. leprae DNA . Moreover , two patients who showed clinical and eletrophysiological manifestations suggestive of PNL were diagnosed with the help of their positive test results in the anti-PGL-I ELISA . In conclusion , detection of antibodies against PGL-I in patients with peripheral neuropathy is useful as an additional laboratory test to help PNL diagnosis . 	2005	2005-10-27	Leprosy review;2005 Sep;76;3;232-40;	Jardim,Marcia R,MR;Antunes,Sergio L G,SL;Simons,Brian,B;Wildenbeest,Joanne G,JG;Nery,Jos√© Augusto C,JA;Illarramendi,Ximena,X;Moraes,Milton O,MO;Martinez,Alejandra N,AN;Oskam,Linda,L;Faber,William R,WR;Sarno,Euzenir N,EN;Sampaio,Elizabeth P,EP;B√ºhrer-S√	-1.1603

In the present study , monocyte-derived DCs from nontreated HIV-1-seropositive patients were electroporated with codon-optimized mRNA encoding consensus HxB-2 Gag protein . These DCs elicited a strong HIV-1 Gag-specific interferon-gamma response by an HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T-cell line . Moreover , hHXB-2 gag mRNA-electroporated DCs also triggered IFN-gamma secretion by autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells , CD4+ T cells , and CD8+ T cells from all patients tested . Next , a novel strategy was developed using autologous virus sequences . Significant specific IFN-gamma T-cell responses were induced in all patients tested by DCs electroporated with patients &apos; autologous polymerase chain reaction -amplified and in vitro-transcribed proviral and plasma viral mRNA encoding either Gag or Env . The stimulatory effect was seen on PBMCs , CD8+ T cells , and CD4+ T cells , demonstrating both major histocompatibility complex class I and MHC class II antigen presentation . Moreover , a significant interleukin-2 T-cell response was induced by DCs electroporated with hHxB-2 or proviral gag mRNA . These findings open a major perspective for the development of patient-specific immunotherapy for HIV-1 disease . 	2005	2005-11-03	Blood;2006 Mar 1;107;5;1818-27;	Van Gulck,Ellen R A,ER;Ponsaerts,Peter,P;Heyndrickx,Leo,L;Vereecken,Katleen,K;Moerman,Filip,F;De Roo,Ann,A;Colebunders,Robert,R;Van den Bosch,Glenn,G;Van Bockstaele,Dirk R,DR;Van Tendeloo,Viggo F I,VF;Allard,Sabine,S;Verrier,Bernard,B;Mara√±√≥n,Concepci√	-0.842134

ERROR 16016279: 16423084	Isolation of Helicobacter pylori from the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn &apos; s disease . 	BACKGROUND : Helicobacter species are associated with inflammatory bowel disease in rodents and in nonhuman primates . Therefore , we prospectively investigated the presence of Helicobacter species in the intestinal mucosa of patients with and without Crohn &apos; s disease by culture and polymerase chain reaction assays . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Mucosal fragments were obtained from the ileum , different colon regions , and rectum of 43 patients with Crohn &apos; s disease and of 74 patients without inflammatory bowel disease . RESULTS : Helicobacter pylori strains , identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing , were more frequently isolated and PCR-detected in the intestinal mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis-like Crohn &apos; s disease than in intestinal mucosa of the control group . Otherwise , anti-H. pylori immunoglobulin G levels were significantly lower in fibrostenosing and fistulating Crohn &apos; s disease subgroups . No other Helicobacter species were found in the intestinal mucosa of the patients . CONCLUSIONS : Although our results suggest an association between the presence of H. pylori in the intestine and ulcerative colitis-like phenotype of Crohn &apos; s disease , H. pylori infection in the actual causality of Crohn &apos; s disease is still to be determined . 	2006	2006-01-21	Helicobacter;2006 Feb;11;1;2-9;	Oliveira,Adriana Gon√ßalves,AG;Rocha,Gifone Aguiar,GA;Rocha,Andreia Maria Camargos,AM;Sanna,Maria das Gra√ßas Pimenta,MG;Moura,S√≠lvia Beleza,SB;Dani,Renato,R;Marinho,Frederico Passos,FP;Moreira,Liano Sia,LS;Ferrari,Maria de Lourdes Abreu,Mde L;Castro,L√	-1.14785

Germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair genes MSH2 and MLH1 account for a significant proportion of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer families . One approach by which development of an efficient DNA-testing procedure can be implemented is to describe the nature and frequency of common mutations in particular ethnic groups . Two hundred and twenty-six patients from families matching the Amsterdam II diagnostic criteria or suspected HNPCC criteria were screened for MSH2 and MLH1 germline mutations . Fifty different pathogenic mutations were found , 25 in MSH2 and 25 in MLH1 . Twenty-four of these had not previously been described in other populations . Among our 78 families with MSH2 or MLH1 mutations , 54 were affected by recurrent mutations including 38 found at least twice in our own series . Two of the most frequent alterations were a substitution of A to T at the splice donor site of intron 5 of MSH2 and a missense change of MLH1 found in 10 and eight families , respectively . Among large deletions detected by the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay , exon 9 deletions in the MSH2 gene were found in two families . Our results indicate that a screening protocol specific for the Polish population that is limited to the detection of all reported mutations will result in the identification of the majority of changes present in MLH1 and MSH2 genes in Polish HNPCC kindreds . 	2006	2006-02-03	Clinical genetics;2006 Jan;69;1;40-7;	Kurzawski,G,G;Suchy,J,J;Lener,M,M;K≈Çujszo-Grabowska,E,E;K≈Çadny,J,J;Safranow,K,K;Jakubowska,K,K;Jakubowska,A,A;Huzarski,T,T;Byrski,T,T;Debniak,T,T;Cybulski,C,C;Gronwald,J,J;Oszurek,O,O;Oszutowska,D,D;Kowalska,E,E;G√≥≈∫d≈∫,S,S;Niepsuj,S,S;S≈Çomski,R,R;P≈	-1.15271

ERROR 16098381: 16510664	Cerebral palsy among very preterm children in relation to gestational age and neonatal ultrasound abnormalities : the EPIPAGE cohort study . 	OBJECTIVE : To estimate the prevalence of cerebral palsy at 2 years of age among children born very preterm , according to gestational age , infant gender , plurality , and neonatal cranial ultrasound abnormalities . METHODS : All infants born between 22 and 32 weeks of gestation in 9 regions of France in 1997 were included in this prospective , population-based , cohort study . The main outcome measure was cerebral palsy prevalence at 2 years . Of the 2364 survivors eligible for follow-up evaluation , 1954 were assessed at 2 years of age . RESULTS : Among the 1954 children assessed at 2 years , 8.2 % had cerebral palsy . Bilateral spastic cerebral palsy , hemiplegia , and monoplegia accounted for 72 % , 9 % , and 10 % of cases , respectively . Fifty percent of the children with cerebral palsy walked independently at the age of 2 , 31 % were unable to walk but could sit independently , and 19 % could not sit . The prevalence of cerebral palsy was 20 % at 24 to 26 weeks of gestation , compared with 4 % at 32 weeks . On the basis of ultrasound findings in the neonatal period , we found that 17 % of children with isolated grade III intraventricular hemorrhage and 25 % of children with white matter damage had cerebral palsy , compared with 4 % of children with normal ultrasound scans . CONCLUSIONS : Despite recent improvements in survival rates , cerebral palsy remains highly prevalent among very preterm children . Severe cranial ultrasound abnormalities predict motor disability strongly , but one third of infants with cerebral palsy had no ultrasound abnormalities . 	2006	2006-03-03	Pediatrics;2006 Mar;117;3;828-35;	Ancel,Pierre-Yves,PY;Livinec,Florence,F;Larroque,B√©atrice,B;Marret,St√©phane,S;Arnaud,Catherine,C;Pierrat,V√©ronique,V;Dehan,Michel,M;N&apos;Guyen,Sylvie,S;Escande,Beno√Æt,B;Burguet,Antoine,A;Thiriez,G√©rard,G;Picaud,Jean-Charles,JC;Andr√©,Monique,M;Br√	-1.03342
ERROR 16123968: 16537713	Genetic variation in the nucleotide excision repair pathway and bladder cancer risk . 	Nucleotide excision repair is critical for protecting against damage from carcinogens in tobacco smoke . We evaluated the influence of common genetic variation in the NER pathway on bladder cancer risk by analyzing 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms in seven NER genes . Our study population included 1,150 patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder and 1,149 control subjects from Spain . Odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were adjusted for age , gender , region , and smoking status . Subjects with the variant genotypes for SNPs in four of the seven genes evaluated had small increases in bladder cancer risk compared to subjects with the homozygous wild-type genotypes : RAD23B IVS5-15A &gt; G , ERCC2 R156R , ERCC1 IVS5+33A &gt; C , and ERCC5 M254V . A global test for pathway effects indicated that genetic variation in NER characterized by the 22 SNPs analyzed in this study significantly predicts bladder cancer risk . Pairwise comparisons suggested that carrying variants in two genes could result in substantial increases in risk . Classification tree analyses suggested the presence of subgroups of individuals defined by smoking and NER genotypes that could have substantial increases in risk . In conclusion , these findings provide support for the influence of genetic variation in NER on bladder cancer risk . A detailed characterization of genetic variation in key NER genes is warranted and might ultimately help identify multiple susceptibility variants that could be responsible for substantial joint increases in risk . 	2006	2006-03-16	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers &amp; prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology;2006 Mar;15;3;536-42;	Garc√≠a-Closas,Montserrat,M;Malats,N√∫ria,N;Real,Francisco X,FX;Welch,Robert,R;Kogevinas,Manolis,M;Chatterjee,Nilanjan,N;Pfeiffer,Ruth,R;Silverman,Debra,D;Dosemeci,Mustafa,M;Tard√≥n,Adonina,A;Serra,Consol,C;Carrato,Alfredo,A;Garc√≠a-Closas,Reina,R;Casta√	-1.5634
ERROR 16164481: 16580437	Autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation in patients with nonacute myocardial infarction : 1-year follow-up . 	OBJECTIVE : To determine the feasibility and safety of skeletal myoblast transplantation in patients with chronic myocardial infarction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting . METHODS : Twelve patients with a previous myocardial infarction and ischemic coronary artery disease underwent treatment with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and intramyocardial injection of autologous skeletal myoblasts cultured with autologous serum . Global and regional cardiac function was assessed by echocardiogram . Fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose and nitrogen 13-ammonia positron emission tomography studies were used to determine cardiac viability and perfusion . A group of historical control patients treated with coronary artery bypass grafting surgery without myoblast transplantation was analyzed . RESULTS : The left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 35.5 % +/- 2.3 % before surgery to 55.1 % +/- 8.2 % at 12 months in the myoblast group and from 33.6 % +/- 9.3 % to 38.6 % +/- 11 % in the control group . Regional contractility also improved in the myoblast group , particularly in cardiac segments treated with skeletal myoblasts . Quantitative fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose and nitrogen 13-ammonia positron emission tomography showed an increase in viability and perfusion 12 months after surgery both globally and in segments treated with myoblasts . Skeletal myoblast implantation was not associated with adverse events or an increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias . CONCLUSIONS : In patients with previous myocardial infarction , treatment with skeletal myoblasts in conjunction with coronary artery bypass is safe and feasible and is associated with an increased global and regional left ventricular function , improvement in viability , and perfusion of cardiac tissue and no significant incidence of arrhythmias . 	2006	2006-04-04	The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery;2006 Apr;131;4;799-804;	Gavira,Juan J,JJ;Herreros,Jes√∫s,J;Perez,Ana,A;Garcia-Velloso,Mar√≠a Jos√©,MJ;Barba,Joaqu√≠n,J;Martin-Herrero,Francisco,F;Ca√±izo,Consuelo,C;Martin-Arnau,Ana,A;Mart√≠-Climent,Josep M,JM;Hern√°ndez,Milagros,M;L√≥pez-Holgado,Natalia,N;Gonz√°lez-Santos,Jos√	-1.10707
ERROR 16187376: 16604541	Multiplexed flow cytometric analyses of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the culture media of oxysterol-treated human monocytic cells and in the sera of atherosclerotic patients . 	BACKGROUND : Some oxysterols are identified in atheromatous plaques and in plasma of atherosclerotic patients . We asked whether they might modulate cytokine secretion on human monocytic cells . In healthy and atherosclerotic subjects , we also investigated the relationships between circulating levels of C-reactive protein , conventional markers of hyperlipidemia , some oxysterols , and various cytokines . METHODS : Different flow cytometric bead-based assays were used to quantify some cytokines in the culture media of oxysterol-treated U937 and THP-1 cells , and in the sera of healthy and atherosclerotic subjects . CRP and markers of hyperlipidemia were determined with routine analytical methods . Oxysterols were quantified by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry . Flow cytometric and biochemical methods were used to measure IL-8 mRNA levels , intracellular IL-8 content , and protein phosphorylation in the mitogenic extracellular kinase / extracellular signal-regulated kinase1 / 2 signaling pathway . RESULTS : All oxysterols investigated are potent in vitro inducers of MCP-1 , MIP-1beta , TNF-alpha , and/or IL-8 secretion , the latter involving the MEK / ERK1 / 2 cell signaling pathway . In healthy and atherosclerotic subjects , no relationships were found between cytokines , CRP , conventional markers of hyperlipidemia , and oxysterols . However , in patients with arterial disorders of the lower limbs , small but statistically significant differences in the circulating levels of CRP , TNF-alpha , and IL-10 were observed comparatively to healthy subjects and according to the atherosclerotic stage considered . CONCLUSIONS : Flow cytometric bead-based assays are well adapted to measure variations of cytokine secretion in the culture media of oxysterol-treated cells and in the sera of healthy and atherosclerotic subjects . They underline the in vitro proinflammatory properties of oxysterols and may permit to distinguish healthy and atherosclerotic subjects , as well as various atherosclerotic stages . 	2006	2006-04-11	Cytometry.

A series of tricyanovinyl -substituted oligothiophenes was synthesized and investigated with a number of physical methods including UV / Vis , IR , and Raman spectroscopy , nonlinear optical measurements , X-ray diffraction , and cyclic voltammetry . Mono- or disubstituted oligomers were prepared by the reaction of tetracyanoethylene with mono- or dilithiated oligomers . The comparative effects of the symmetric and asymmetric substitutions in the electronic and molecular properties have been addressed . These oligomers display dramatic reductions in both their optical and electrochemical band gaps in comparison with unsubstituted molecules . The analysis of the electronic properties of the molecules was assisted by density functional theory calculations , which are in excellent agreement with the experimental data . TCV substitution influences the energies of the frontier orbitals , especially with respect to the stabilization of LUMO orbitals . X-ray structural characterization of a monosubstituted oligomer exhibits pi-stacking with favorable intermolecular interactions . NLO results agree with the role of the intramolecular charge-transfer feature in the asymmetric samples . These results furthermore exalt the role of conformational flexibility in the disubstituted compounds and reveal an unexpected nonlinear optical activity for symmetric molecules . Regarding the electronic structure , the interpretation of the vibrational data reflects the balanced interplay between aromatic and quinoid forms , finely tuned by the chain length and substitution pattern . The electronic and structural properties are consistent with the semiconducting properties exhibited by these materials in thin film transistors . 	2006	2006-04-22	Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany);2006 Jul 17;12;21;5458-70;	Casado,Juan,J;Ruiz Delgado,M Carmen,MC;Rey Merch√°n,M Carmen,MC;Hern√°ndez,V√≠ctor,V;L√≥pez Navarrete,Juan T,JT;Pappenfus,Ted M,TM;Williams,Nathaniel,N;Stegner,William J,WJ;Johnson,Jared C,JC;Edlund,Brett A,BA;Janzen,Daron E,DE;Mann,Kent R,KR;Orduna,Jes√	-0.89707

Seizures due to MCD are frequently pharmacoresistant , especially those associated to focal cortical dysplasia . Surgical therapy results have been reported since 1971 , however , currently available data from surgical series are still limited , mainly due to small number of patients , distinct selection of candidates and surgical strategies , variable pathological diagnosis and inadequate follow-up .

BACKGROUND : Intracranial haemorrhage is the type of stroke associated with the highest death rate , and about 30 % of ICH occurs in patients on antithrombotic treatment . This study relates clinical presentations and outcome of ICH patients on oral anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy admitted to 33 Italian emergency departments . METHODS : Consecutive patients were enrolled after cranial computed tomography . Primary outcome was the Modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months of follow-up . Common descriptive statistics were computed after stratification for traumatic or spontaneous ICH and identification of the anatomical location of bleeding . Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess predictors of death . RESULTS : We recruited 434 patients on AP therapy and 232 on OA . There were 432 spontaneous and 234 traumatic ICH patients . The proportions of AP and OA patients undergoing neurosurgery were 21.8 and 19.4 % , respectively , while &lt; 30 % underwent procoagulant medical treatment . At the 3-month follow-up , the case fatality rate was 42.0 % , while disability or death was 68.1 % . The odds ratio for death in OA versus AP patients was 2.63 in the whole population and 2.80 in intraparenchymal event patients . Glasgow Coma Scale , age , spontaneous event and anticoagulant use were found to be predictors of death both in traumatic and spontaneous events . CONCLUSION : This study confirms the high prevalence of death or disability in OA and AP patients with ICH . As far as the determinants of mortality and disability are concerned , the results of this study might be useful in the clinical management and allocation of resources in the ED setting . The observed low use of procoagulant therapy highlights the need for ED educational programmes to heighten the awareness of available and effective haemostatic treatments . 	2006	2006-07-19	Cerebrovascular diseases (Basel, Switzerland);2006;22;4;286-93;	Baldi,G,G;Altomonte,F,F;Altomonte,M,M;Ghirarduzzi,A,A;Brusasco,C,C;Parodi,R C,RC;Ricciardi,A,A;Remollino,V,V;Spisni,V,V;Saporito,A,A;Caiazza,A,A;Musso,G,G;Cervellin,G,G;Lamberti,S,S;Buzzalino,M,M;De Giorgi,F,F;Del Prato,C,C;Golinelli,M P,MP;Gai,V,V;Mons√	-1.53164

AIMS : Different epidemiological studies have demonstrated that some ethanol containing beverages intake could be associated with a reduction of cardiovascular mortality , effect attributed in part to its antioxidant properties . Nuclear factor-kappa B is a redox sensitive transcription factor implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis . We have examined the effect of four different ethanol containing beverages on the activation of NF-kappaB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and circulating concentrations of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in healthy volunteers receiving a fat-enriched diet . METHODS AND RESULTS : Sixteen volunteers received 16 g / m of ethanol in form of red wine , spirits or no ethanol intake along with a fat-enriched diet during 5 days and all of them took all alcohols at different periods . NF-kappaB activation and circulating MCP-1 levels were examined in blood samples taken before and after 5 days of ethanol intake . Subjects receiving a fat-enriched diet had increased NF-kappaB activation in PBMC at day 5 . Furthermore , MCP-1 levels were increased in plasma at day 5 . Red wine intake and some ethanol beverages containing polyphenols prevented NF-kappaB activation and decreased MCP-1 release . CONCLUSION : Consumption of moderate amounts of alcoholic drinks containing polyphenols decreases NF-kappaB activation in PBMCs and MCP-1 plasma levels during a fat-enriched diet . Our results provide additional evidence of the anti-inflammatory effects of some ethanol containing beverages , further supporting the idea that its moderate consumption may help to reduce overall cardiovascular mortality . 	2006	2006-09-15	Atherosclerosis;2007 Jun;192;2;335-41;	Blanco-Colio,Luis Miguel,LM;Mu√±oz-Garc√≠a,Bego√±a,B;Mart√≠n-Ventura,Jose Luis,JL;Alvarez-Sala,Luis Antonio,LA;Castilla,Manuela,M;Bustamante,Ana,A;Lamuela-Ravent√≥s,Rosa Mar√≠a,RM;G√≥mez-Gerique,Juan,J;Fern√°ndez-Cruz,Arturo,A;Mill√°n,Jes√∫s,J;Egido,Jes√	-1.14348

ERROR 16594262: 17040669	. 	INTRODUCTION : Sarcomas are rare tumors that develop from mesenchymal cells . Their management is difficult due to their changing histology , location , and behavior . In this article , we discuss the use of two intraoperative therapeutic intensification techniques , intraoperative radiotherapy and hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy , in the treatment of locally advanced abdominal sarcomas and peritoneal sarcomatosis . MATERIAL AND METHODS : We analyzed a series of 20 consecutive patients diagnosed with advanced abdominal sarcoma and 5 patients with a diagnosis of peritoneal sarcomatosis who were evaluated and treated in our department from December 1996 to October 2005 . In advanced abdominal sarcoma , we performed complete or maximal resection followed by IORT . In peritoneal sarcomatosis we performed massive cytoreduction followed by HIIC . RESULTS : The survival rate in advanced abdominal sarcomas without sarcomatosis was 65 % at 26 months . Among the 5 patients diagnosed with peritoneal sarcomatosis , 3 were alive , and 2 were without recurrence at 20 months of follow-up . CONCLUSIONS : IORT associated with radical surgery seems to improve local control and survival in advanced abdominal sarcomas . Maximal cytoreduction plus HIIC used as treatment of peritoneal sarcomatosis is a feasible technique that offers a therapeutic option with curative intent . 	2006	2006-10-17	Cirug√≠a espa√±ola;2006 Oct;80;4;200-5;	Garc√≠a Sabrido,Jos√© Luis,JL;Velasco S√°nchez,Enrique,E;Calvo,Felipe,F;G√≥mez Lanz,Laura,L;S√°nchez Tocino,Juan Mar√≠a,JM;Argudo Garijo,Salvador,S;Ruiz G√≥mez,Francisco,F;Rodr√≠guez-Bachiller,Luis,L;Gonz√°lez Bay√≥n,Luis,L;Valdecantos Montes,Eladio,E;P√	-1.40929

INTRODUCTION : Intestinal parasitic infections , especially due to helminths , increase anemia in pregnant women . The results of this are low pregnancy weight gain and IUGR , followed by LBW , with its associated greater risks of infection and higher perinatal mortality rates . For these reasons , in the setting of no large previous studies in Venezuela about this problem , a national multicentric study was conducted . METHODS : Pregnant women from nine states were studied , a prenatal evaluation with a coproparasitological study . Univariated and multivariated analyses were made to determine risk factors for intestinal parasitosis and related anemia . RESULTS : During 19 months , 1038 pregnant women were included and evaluated . Intestinal parasitosis was evidenced in 73.9 % : A lumbricoides 57.0 % , T trichiura 36.0 % , G lamblia 14.1 % , E hystolitica 12.0 % , N americanus 8.1 % , E vermicularis 6.3 % , S stercoralis 3.3 % . Relative risk for anemia in those women with intestinal parasitosis was 2.56 . DISCUSSION : Intestinal parasitoses could be associated with conditions for development of anemia at pregnancy . These features reflect the need of routine coproparasitological study among pregnant women in rural and endemic zones for intestinal parasites . Further therapeutic and prophylactic protocols are needed . Additional research on pregnant intestinal parasitic infection impact on newborn health is also considered . 	2006	2006-11-10	Infectious diseases in obstetrics and gynecology;2006;2006;;23125;	Rodr√≠guez-Morales,Alfonso J,AJ;Barbella,Rosa A,RA;Case,Cynthia,C;Arria,Melissa,M;Ravelo,Marisela,M;Perez,Henry,H;Urdaneta,Oscar,O;Gervasio,Gloria,G;Rubio,Nestor,N;Maldonado,Andrea,A;Aguilera,Ymora,Y;Viloria,Anna,A;Blanco,Juan J,JJ;Colina,Magdary,M;Hern√	-1.22866

Recent characterization of the ability of uncoupling protein 2 to reduce ATP production and inhibit insulin secretion by pancreatic beta-cells has placed this mitochondrial protein as a candidate target for therapeutics in diabetes mellitus . In the present study we evaluate the effects of short-term treatment of two animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus with an antisense oligonucleotide to UCP2 . In both models , Swiss mice and ob / ob mice , the treatment resulted in a significant improvement in the hyperglycemic syndrome . This effect was due not only to an improvement of insulin secretion , but also to improved peripheral insulin action . In isolated pancreatic islets , the partial inhibition of UCP2 increased ATP content , followed by increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion . This was not accompanied by increased expression of enzymes involved in protection against oxidative stress . The evaluation of insulin action in peripheral tissues revealed that the inhibition of UCP2 expression significantly improved insulin signal transduction in adipose tissue . In conclusion , short-term inhibition of UCP2 expression ameliorates the hyperglycemic syndrome in two distinct animal models of obesity and diabetes . Metabolic improvement is due to a combined effect on insulin-producing pancreatic islets and in at least one peripheral tissue that acts as a target for insulin . 	2007	2007-01-09	FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology;2007 Apr;21;4;1153-63;	De Souza,Cl√°udio T,CT;Ara√∫jo,Eliana P,EP;Stoppiglia,Luiz F,LF;Pauli,Jos√© R,JR;Ropelle,Eduardo,E;Rocco,Silvana A,SA;Marin,Rodrigo M,RM;Franchini,Kleber G,KG;Carvalheira,Jos√© B,JB;Saad,M√°rio J,MJ;Boschero,Antonio C,AC;Carneiro,Everardo M,EM;Velloso,L√	-1.32721
ERROR 16794999: 17255271	Multiple gene expression classifiers from different array platforms predict poor prognosis of colorectal cancer . 	PURPOSE : This study aimed to develop gene classifiers to predict colorectal cancer recurrence . We investigated whether gene classifiers derived from two tumor series using different array platforms could be independently validated by application to the alternate series of patients . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Colorectal tumors from New Zealand and Germany patients had a minimum follow-up of 5 years . RNA was profiled using oligonucleotide printed microarrays and Affymetrix arrays . Classifiers based on clinical data , gene expression data , and a combination of the two were produced and used to predict recurrence . The use of gene expression information was found to improve the predictive ability in both data sets . The New Zealand and German gene classifiers were cross-validated on the German and New Zealand data sets , respectively , to validate their predictive power . Survival analyses were done to evaluate the ability of the classifiers to predict patient survival . RESULTS : The prediction rates for the New Zealand and German gene-based classifiers were 77 % and 84 % , respectively . Despite significant differences in study design and technologies used , both classifiers retained prognostic power when applied to the alternate series of patients . Survival analyses showed that both classifiers gave a better stratification of patients than the traditional clinical staging . One classifier contained genes associated with cancer progression , whereas the other had a large immune response gene cluster concordant with the role of a host immune response in modulating colorectal cancer outcome . CONCLUSIONS : The successful reciprocal validation of gene-based classifiers on different patient cohorts and technology platforms supports the power of microarray technology for individualized outcome prediction of colorectal cancer patients . Furthermore , many of the genes identified have known biological functions congruent with the predicted outcomes . 	2007	2007-01-27	Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research;2007 Jan 15;13;2 Pt 1;498-507;	Lin,Yu-Hsin,YH;Friederichs,Jan,J;Black,Michael A,MA;Mages,J√∂rg,J;Rosenberg,Robert,R;Guilford,Parry J,PJ;Phillips,Vicky,V;Thompson-Fawcett,Mark,M;Kasabov,Nikola,N;Toro,Tumi,T;Merrie,Arend E,AE;van Rij,Andre,A;Yoon,Han-Seung,HS;McCall,John L,JL;Siewert,J√	-1.84931

We have previously reported significant inverse associations between bladder cancer risk and dietary intake of vitamins B2 , B6 , B12 , folate and protein in a hospital-based bladder cancer case-control study conducted in Spain . Because these dietary factors are involved in the one-carbon metabolism pathway , we evaluated associations between bladder cancer risk and 33 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 8 genes and interactions with dietary variables involved in this pathway . Two SNPs in the CTH gene were significantly associated with bladder cancer risk . OR for heterozygous and the homozygous variants compared to homozygous wild-type individuals were : 1.37 IVS3-66 A &gt; C and 1.22 IVS10-430 C &gt; T. Because the CTH gene is important for glutathione synthesis , we examined interactions with the GSTM1 gene , which codes for glutathione S-transferase muu . Increased risk for individuals with the IVS10-430 CT or TT genotype was limited to those with the GSTM1 null genotype . No other SNPs were associated with risk of bladder cancer . These findings suggest that common genetic variants in the one-carbon pathway may not play an important role in the etiology of bladder cancer . However , our results provide some evidence that variation in glutathione synthesis may contribute to risk , particularly among individuals who carry a deletion in GSTM1 . Additional work is needed to comprehensively evaluate genomic variation in CTH and related genes in the trans-sulfuration pathway and bladder cancer risk . 	2007	2007-02-22	International journal of cancer.

ERROR 16901232: 17368238	Identification of MYH mutation carriers in colorectal cancer : a multicenter , case-control , population-based study . 	BACKGROUND &amp; # 38 ; AIMS : Whereas it has conclusively been demonstrated that biallelic MutY human homolog mutations confer a significant risk for colorectal cancer , the influence of monoallelic mutations remains controversial . Characterization of MYH-associated CRC is critical to identify individuals who might benefit from preventive strategies . This prospective , multicenter , case-control , population-based study was aimed at establishing the CRC risk associated with specific germline MYH mutations and devising a set of clinical criteria to identify MYH carriers among newly diagnosed CRC . METHODS : Genotyping for Y165C and G382D was performed by TaqMan technology . Single-stranded conformation polymorphism analysis was performed in heterozygotes to screen for mutations in the entire gene . All individuals were re-screened for any additional pathogenic variant . RESULTS : Biallelic and monoallelic MYH mutations were found in 8 and 19 of 1116 CRC patients , respectively . None of the 934 control subjects carried biallelic mutations , whereas 22 of them were monoallelic carriers . In a meta-analysis including all previous case-control studies , monoallelic MYH carriers were not at increased risk for CRC , although a significant association was found with the Y165C mutation in either homozygotes or heterozygotes . Furthermore , presence of more than 15 synchronous colorectal adenomas or CRC diagnosed before the age of 50 years was the most effective set of criteria for the identification of biallelic MYH mutation carriers . CONCLUSIONS : This study proposes the first set of clinical criteria designed to identify CRC patients with biallelic MYH mutations , and it argues against an increased risk for monoallelic carriers . 	2007	2007-03-21	Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association;2007 Mar;5;3;379-87;	Balaguer,Francesc,F;Castellv√≠-Bel,Sergi,S;Castells,Antoni,A;Andreu,Montserrat,M;Mu√±oz,Jenifer,J;Gisbert,Javier P,JP;Llor,Xavier,X;Jover,Rodrigo,R;de Cid,Rafael,R;Gonzalo,Vict√≤ria,V;Bessa,Xavier,X;Xicola,Rosa M,RM;Pons,Elisenda,E;Alenda,Cristina,C;Pay√	-1.18338

UNLABELLED : The VDR is a prime candidate gene for osteoporosis . Here , we studied three common VDR haplotypes in relation to bone phenotypes in 5014 participants of the global MrOS Study . We also studied the relative expression of the haplotypes in human bone cells . One haplotype was associated with increased fracture risk and differently expressed in primary human bone cells . INTRODUCTION : Vitamin D plays an essential role in skeletal metabolism by binding to its nuclear steroid receptor , the vitamin D receptor . The heritability of BMD is well established , and the VDR gene is considered a prime candidate suggested to partially account for genetically controlled BMD variance in the population . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Here , we reconstructed common haplotypes in the VDR 3 &apos; untranslated region and studied the association to BMD and risk of vertebral fractures in elderly men from Sweden and Hong Kong , all participants of the global MrOS Study . To assess any functional implications of the VDR polymorphisms , we studied allele-specific expressions of the different VDR 3 &apos; UTR haplotypes in the normal chromosomal context of 70 unrelated human trabecular bone samples . This was performed by quantitative genotyping of coding polymorphisms in RNA samples and in corresponding DNA samples isolated from the bone samples . RESULTS : Three major haplotypes were reconstructed and in agreement with the previously well-defined baT , BAt , and bAT haplotypes , herein denoted Hap1 , Hap2 , and Hap3 . The Hap1 haplotype was independently associated with increased risk of vertebral fractures in Swedish men and with lower lumbar spine BMD in elderly men from Sweden and Hong Kong . The VDR gene was also shown to exhibit a 3 &apos; UTR haplotype dependent allelic imbalance , indicating that the VDR Hap1 allele was overexpressed in human trabecular bone samples . CONCLUSIONS : The results indicate that the relatively overexpressed VDR Hap1 haplotype could be considered a risk allele for osteoporosis regardless of ethnicity . 	2007	2007-03-21	Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research;2007 Jun;22;6;832-40;	Grundberg,Elin,E;Lau,Edith M C,EM;Pastinen,Tomi,T;Kindmark,Andreas,A;Nilsson,Olof,O;Ljunggren,Osten,O;Mellstr√∂m,Dan,D;Orwoll,Eric,E;Redlund-Johnell,Inga,I;Holmberg,Anna,A;Gurd,Scott,S;Leung,Ping Chung,PC;Kwok,Timothy,T;Ohlsson,Claes,C;Mallmin,Hans,H;Br√	-1.09402

OBJECTIVES : The objective of this study was to identify systemic diseases associated with hyposalivation and xerostomia and develop evidence-based management recommendations for hyposalivation / xerostomia . STUDY DESIGN : Literature searches covered the English language medical literature from 1966 to 2005 . An evidence-based review process was applied to management studies published from 2002 to 2005 . RESULTS : Several systemic diseases were identified . From studies published 2002 to 2005 , 15 were identified as high-quality studies and were used to support management recommendations : pilocarpine and cevimeline are recommended for treating hyposalivation and xerostomia in primary and secondary Sj√∂gren &apos; s syndrome . IFN-alpha lozenges may enhance saliva flow in primary SS patients . Anti-TNF-alpha agents , such as infliximab or etanercept , are not recommended to treat hyposalivation in SS . Dehydroepiandrosterone is not recommended to relieve hyposalivation or xerostomia in primary SS . There was not enough evidence to support any recommendations for the use of local stimulants , lubricants , and protectants for hyposalivation / xerostomia . However , professional judgment and patient preferences may support the use of a specific product for an individual patient . CONCLUSIONS : These evidence-based management recommendations should guide the clinician &apos; s management decisions for patients with salivary dysfunction related to systemic disease .

CONTEXT : Several endocrine disorders that share resistance to PTH are grouped under the term pseudohypoparathyroidism . PHP type I , associated with blunted PTH-induced nephrogenous cAMP formation and phosphate excretion , is subdivided according to the presence or absence of additional endocrine abnormalities , Albright &apos; s hereditary osteodystrophy , and reduced Gsalpha activity caused by GNAS mutations . OBJECTIVE : We sought to identify the molecular defect in four unrelated patients who were thought to have PHP-Ia because of PTH and TSH resistance and mild AHO features . METHODS : Gsalpha activity and mutation analysis , and assessment of GNAS haplotype , methylation , and gene expression were performed for probands and family members . RESULTS : Two patients showed modest decreases in erythrocyte Gsalpha activity . Instead of Gsalpha point mutations , however , all four patients showed methylation defects of the GNAS locus , a feature previously described only for PHP-Ib . Furthermore , one patient with an isolated loss of GNAS exon A / B methylation had the 3-kb STX16 deletion frequently identified in PHP-Ib patients . In all but one of the remaining patients , haplotype analysis excluded large deletions or uniparental disomy as the cause of the observed methylation changes . CONCLUSIONS : Our investigations indicate that an overlap may exist between molecular and clinical features of PHP-Ia and PHP-Ib . No current mechanisms can explain the AHO-like features of our patients , some of which may not be linked to GNAS . Therefore , patients with hormone resistance and AHO-like features in whom coding Gsalpha mutations have been excluded should be evaluated for epigenetic alterations within GNAS . 	2007	2007-04-05	The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism;2007 Jun;92;6;2370-3;	de Nanclares,Guiomar P√©rez,GP;Fern√°ndez-Rebollo,Eduardo,E;Santin,Izortze,I;Garc√≠a-Cuartero,Beatriz,B;Gaztambide,Sonia,S;Men√©ndez,Edelmiro,E;Morales,Maria Jose,MJ;Pombo,Manuel,M;Bilbao,Jos√© Ram√≥n,JR;Barros,Francisco,F;Zazo,Nuria,N;Ahrens,Wiebke,W;J√	-0.969249

METHODS : This review , and the whole series on intracranial aneurysms , is mainly based on the personal microneurosurgical experience of the senior author in 2 Finnish centers , which serve without patient selection the catchment area in southern and eastern Finland . RESULTS : These 2 centers have treated more than 10,000 patients with intracranial aneurysm &apos; s since 1951 . In the Kuopio Cerebral Aneurysm Data Base of 3005 patients with 4253 aneurysms , MbifAs formed 30 % of all ruptured aneurysms , 36 % of all unruptured aneurysms , 35 % of all giant aneurysms , and 89 % of all MCA aneurysms . Importantly , in 45 % , rupture of MbifA caused an ICH . CONCLUSIONS : Middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysms are often broad necked and may involve one or both branches of the bifurcation . The anatomical and hemodynamic features of MbifAs make them usually more favorable for microneurosurgical treatment . In population-based services , MbifAs are frequent targets of elective surgery , acute surgery , and emergency surgery , even advanced approaches .

Multiple transgenic mouse lines expressing CASQ2 from 2- to 6-fold possess structurally normal hearts without any sign of hypertrophy . The hearts displayed normal ventricular function . Myocytes isolated from TG mice had diminished I-induced Ca2+ transient amplitude and duration , as well as increased Ca2+ spark frequency . These myocytes , when exposed to isoproterenol and caffeine , displayed disturbances in their rhythmic Ca2+ oscillations and membrane potential , and delayed afterdepolarizations . ECG monitoring revealed that TG mice challenged with isoproterenol and caffeine developed complex ventricular arrhythmias , including non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia . CONCLUSIONS : The findings of the present study demonstrate that expression of mutant CASQ2 in the mouse heart results in abnormal myocyte Ca2+ handling and predisposes to complex ventricular arrhythmias similar to the CPVT phenotype observed in human patients . 	2007	2007-04-24	Cardiovascular research;2007 Jul 1;75;1;69-78;	Dirksen,Wessel P,WP;Lacombe,Veronique A,VA;Chi,Mei,M;Kalyanasundaram,Anuradha,A;Viatchenko-Karpinski,Serge,S;Terentyev,Dmitry,D;Zhou,Zhixiang,Z;Vedamoorthyrao,Srikanth,S;Li,Ning,N;Chiamvimonvat,Nipavan,N;Carnes,Cynthia A,CA;Franzini-Armstrong,Clara,C;Gy√	-0.90307
ERROR 16991286: 17464969	Diagnostic accuracy of the Multistix 8 SG reagent strip in diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis . 	Recent studies have shown that the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can be rapidly obtained using leukocyte esterase reagent strips . However , published studies were restricted to one or two centers , and the number of patients with SBP was thus limited . The aims of the current prospective multicenter study were : to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the Multistix 8SG urine test for the diagnosis of SBP ; and to assess the prevalence of SBP . From January to May 2004 , 2 reactive strips were tested independently in inpatients with cirrhosis and in outpatients undergoing paracentesis . Cultures of ascitic fluid were performed at the bedside using aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles . Two thousand one hundred twenty-three paracenteses were performed in 1,041 patients from 70 centers . One hundred seventeen samples , obtained from 91 patients , had ascites polymorphonuclear cell counts &gt; or=250 / microl , among which 56 were associated with positive ascitic fluid cultures . The prevalence of SBP was 5.5 % in the whole population , 9 % in inpatients , and 1.3 % in outpatients . The prevalence of SBP was 0.57 % in asymptomatic outpatients versus 2.4 % in symptomatic outpatients . Using a threshold of 2+ for positivity of the reagent strip , sensitivity was 45.3 % for the diagnosis of SBP , specificity was 99.2 % , positive predictive value was 77.9 % , and negative predictive value was 96.9 % . CONCLUSION : This study confirms the low prevalence of SBP in asymptomatic outpatients according to a priori defined criteria , and indicates an absence of diagnostic efficacy for this specific strip test . 	2007	2007-04-28	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.);2007 May;45;5;1275-81;	Nousbaum,Jean-Baptiste,JB;Cadranel,Jean-Fran√ßois,JF;Nahon,Pierre,P;Khac,Eric Nguyen,EN;Moreau,Richard,R;Th√©venot,Thierry,T;Silvain,Christine,C;Bureau,Christophe,C;Nouel,Olivier,O;Pilette,Christophe,C;Paupard,Thierry,T;Vanbiervliet,Geoffroy,G;Oberti,Fr√	-1.30007

ERROR 17012191: 17488137	The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for Patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease : responsiveness to change and English language validation . 	BACKGROUND : A validated productivity questionnaire , the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire for Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease , exists for Swedish patients with GERD . OBJECTIVE : To assess responsiveness to change of the WPAI-GERD and construct validity of the English language version . METHODS : We used the WPAI-GERD in a before-after treatment clinical study of Canadian GERD patients with moderate or severe symptoms treated with esomeprazole 40 mg once daily for 4 weeks . We measured productivity variables including GERD-specific absence from work , reduced productivity while at work and reduced productivity while carrying out regular daily activities other than work during the preceding week . RESULTS : The analysis included 217 patients , of whom 71 % were employed . Before treatment , employed patients reported an average 0.9 hours of absence from work due to GERD and 14.0 % reduced work productivity in the previous week , as well as 21.0 % reduced productivity in daily activities . After treatment , the corresponding figures decreased to 0.3 hours , 3.0 % and 4.9 % , respectively . Thus , the improvement in productivity was 0.6 hours for absence from work and 11.0 % units for reduced work productivity . This translated into an avoided loss of work productivity of 5.3 hours in total on a weekly basis per employed patient . In addition , a 16.1 % unit improvement for reduced productivity in activities was observed . Cross-sectional correlation coefficients of WPAI variables with symptoms and health-related quality of life supported cross-sectional construct validity . Corresponding change score correlations between WPAI variables and HR-QOL supported longitudinal construct validity of the WPAI-GERD while low change score correlations between productivity variables and relevant symptoms did not . CONCLUSION : The English version of the WPAI-GERD showed good cross-sectional construct validity , and results indicated that the WPAI-GERD is responsive to change . Although the results also indicated that longitudinal construct validity may be poor , the overall findings suggest that further study of the instrument remains warranted . 	2007	2007-05-10	PharmacoEconomics;2007;25;5;385-96;	Wahlqvist,Peter,P;Guyatt,Gordon H,GH;Armstrong,David,D;Degl&apos;innocenti,Alessio,A;Heels-Ansdell,Diane,D;El-Dika,Samer,S;Wiklund,Ingela,I;Fallone,Carlo A,CA;Tanser,Lisa,L;Veldhuyzen van Zanten,Sander,S;Austin,Peggy,P;Barkun,Alan N,AN;Chiba,Naoki,N;Sch√	-1.40762

Aseptic abscesses are characterized by deep , sterile , round lesions consisting of neutrophil that do not respond to antibiotics but improve dramatically with corticosteroids . We report the clinical , laboratory , and radiologic characteristics and the associated conditions of 29 patients from the French Register on AA plus 1 patient from the Netherlands . The mean age of patients at AA diagnosis was 29 years . The main clinical manifestations of AA were fever , abdominal pain , and weight loss . Duration of symptoms was 4.7 months on average until abscesses were discovered . The abscesses involved the spleen in 27 / 29 patients . In 7 they were unifocal and in the others they were multifocal , involving in addition the abdominal lymph nodes in 14 , liver in 12 , lung in 5 , pancreas in 2 , and brain in 2 . They were not splenic in 3 , including 2 with abdominal lymph nodes and 1 with superficial lymph nodes and testicle and lung involvement . Twenty-two patients had elevated white blood cell and neutrophil count ; antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies with a perinuclear , cytoplasmic or atypical pattern were positive in 21 % of the 24 patients tested . Twenty-one patients had inflammatory bowel disease , which preceded the occurrence of abscesses in 7 , was concomitant in 7 , and appeared secondarily in 7 . Six patients had neutrophilic dermatosis , 3 had relapsing polychondritis as an associated condition , and 3 others had monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance . Three patients had no associated condition . Splenectomy was performed in 15 patients . All patients received steroid therapy . Thirteen were given additional immunosuppressive therapy , 1 immediately and the others after a relapse , of whom 3 were also treated by anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agents . Mean follow-up was 7 years . Eighteen patients experienced 1 or several relapses , but there was no death related to AA . Relapses occurred on immunosuppressive therapy in 2 patients and off immunosuppressive therapy in the others while corticosteroids were being tapered . We surveyed the literature and analyzed 19 additional cases . AA is an emergent and probably underrecognized entity . It represents an apparently noninfectious inflammatory disorder involving neutrophils that responds to corticosteroid therapy . AA mainly affects patients with IBD but also affects those with other conditions , or with no other apparent disease . 	2007	2007-05-17	Medicine;2007 May;86;3;145-61;	Andr√©,Marc F J,MF;Piette,Jean-Charles,JC;K√©m√©ny,Jean-Louis,JL;Ninet,Jacques,J;Jego,Patrick,P;Del√®vaux,Isabelle,I;Wechsler,Bertrand,B;Weiller,Pierre-Jean,PJ;Franc√®s,Camille,C;Bl√©try,Olivier,O;Wismans,Pieter J,PJ;Rousset,Hugues,H;Colombel,Jean-Fr√©d√	-1.36474
ERROR 17043120: 17521546	. 	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES : Heart failure is an important public health concern . Our aim was to evaluate the characteristics of HF patients in Galicia , Spain . METHODS : This descriptive , cross-sectional , multicenter study involved 149 primary care physicians and recorded the characteristics of 1195 patients diagnosed with HF . RESULTS : Some 48 % of patients were male , and their mean age was 76 years , though women were older . Disease history included hypertension in 82 % , hyperlipidemia in 47 % , diabetes in 31 % , atrial fibrillation in 49 % , valvular disease in 35 % , and ischemic heart disease in 32 % . Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 131 mm Hg and 76 mm Hg , respectively . Pressure was controlled in 43 % of patients . Overall , 67 % underwent echocardiography , of whom 61 % had preserved systolic function . Coronary angiography was performed in 47 % of patients with ischemic heart disease , more frequently in males than females . The most commonly prescribed drugs were diuretics , angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors , angiotensin II receptor antagonists , and beta-blockers . Patients with depressed systolic function were more frequently prescribed beta-blockers , ACE inhibitors , and antialdosterones . During the last year , 57 % of patients had been admitted to hospital , of whom 45 % were admitted for cardiovascular reasons . CONCLUSIONS : The most prevalent form of HF in Galicia was HF with preserved systolic function , which was mostly associated with high blood pressure due to poor control . In patients with ischemic heart disease , the use of coronary angiography was influenced by sex . Drug treatment was suboptimal . Intervention programs are required to improve care in these patients . 	2007	2007-05-25	Revista espa√±ola de cardiolog√≠a;2007 Apr;60;4;373-83;	Otero-Ravi√±a,Fernando,F;Grigorian-Shamagian,Lilian,L;Fransi-Galiana,Luis,L;N√°zara-Otero,Carlos,C;Fern√°ndez-Villaverde,Jos√© M,JM;del Alamo-Alonso,Alberto,A;Nieto-Pol,Enrique,E;de Santiago-Boull√≥n,Miguel,M;L√≥pez-Rodr√≠guez,Isidro,I;Cardona-Vidal,Jos√	-1.18356
ERROR 17057134: 17539320	. 	BACKGROUND : Fetal heart diseases are increasingly frequent . These are part of birth defects and , therefore , appear in early phases of the gestation . Diagnosis or early detection of functional and structural abnormalities of the heart allows to the obstetrician and the pediatric cardiologist to plan , in a timely manner , the treatment and prenatal and postnatal monitoring with the purpose of preventing complications . OBJECTIVE : To determine the types and frequencies of heart diseases in pregnancies with high-risk factors . PATIENTS AND METHOD : It was analized an observational , descriptive and retrospective series of cases . From January 2003 to June 2006 , fetal echocardiograms were made in women with pregnancies longer than 15 weeks and with high-risk factors . At childbirth was made a cardiovascular evaluation . Analysis was carried out through descriptive statistics . RESULTS : maternal age average was of 27.3 +/- 6.8 years ; gestational age was of 31 +/- 5 weeks . In total , there were carried out 275 fetal echocardiograms in 208 patients ; in 56 of them , was made one fetal ecocardiogram , two in 37 and three in 15 . Risk factors of reference to the specialized medical unit were : abnormalities detected through obstetrical ultrasound , tachycardia-bradycardia-arrhythmia , probable chromosomic anomalies , oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios , familiar antecedents of congenital heart diseases , others . Heart disease was diagnosed by fetal echocardiogram in 55 patient : unique ventricle , hypoplastic right ventricle , hypoplastic left ventricle , congenital complete heart block , Ebstein and dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves , tumor , ectopia cordis , auriculoventricular channel , supraventricular tachycardia , supraventricular extrasystole and other . Diagnosis was confirmed at childbirth in 99.5 % of the cases . The treatment was initiated in uterus for arrhythmia and cardiac insufficiency in 19 patients . The patients with high-risk cardiopathy were evaluated at beginning through specialized cardiological treatment and then they were transferred to the service of pediatric cardiology . CONCLUSIONS : Frequency of fetal heart diseases in patients with high-risk factors is of 25.4 % . In these patients , the fetal echocardiogram allows planning the optimal cardiological and obstetric treatment as well as to inform to the relatives . 	2007	2007-06-02	Ginecolog√≠a y obstetricia de M√©xico;2006 Dec;74;12;645-56;	Hinojosa Cruz,Juan Carlos,JC;Luis Miranda,Ra√∫l San,RS;Veloz Mart√≠nez,Mar√≠a Guadalupe,MG;Puello Tamara,Edgardo,E;Arias Monroy,Laura Guadalupe,LG;Barra Urrutia,Abel,A;Cetina Camara,Nancy del Perpetuo Socorro,Ndel P;del Angel,Guadalupe,G;Guti√©rrez Gonz√	-1.26331

ERROR 17150249: 17637808	Whole mitochondrial genome screening in maternally inherited non-syndromic hearing impairment using a microarray resequencing mitochondrial DNA chip . 	Mitochondrial DNA mutations have been implicated in non-syndromic hearing loss either as primary or as predisposing factors . As only a part of the mitochondrial genome is usually explored in deafness , its prevalence is probably under-estimated . Among 1350 families with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss collected through a French collaborative network , we selected 29 large families with a clear maternal lineage and screened them for known mtDNA mutations in 12S rRNA , tRNASer and tRNALeu genes . When no mutation could be identified , a whole mitochondrial genome screening was performed , using a microarray resequencing chip : the MitoChip version 2.0 developed by Affymetrix Inc . Known mtDNA mutations was found in nine of the 29 families , which are described in the article : five with A1555G , two with the T7511C , one with 7472insC and one with A3243G mutation . In the remaining 20 families , the resequencing Mitochip detected 258 mitochondrial homoplasmic variants and 107 potentially heteroplasmic variants . Controls were made by direct sequencing on selected fragments and showed a high sensibility of the MitoChip but a low specificity , especially for heteroplasmic variations . An original analysis on the basis of species conservation , frequency and phylogenetic investigation was performed to select the more probably pathogenic variants . The entire genome analysis allowed us to identify five additional families with a putatively pathogenic mitochondrial variant : T669C , C1537T , G8078A , G12236A and G15077A . These results indicate that the new MitoChip platform is a rapid and valuable tool for identification of new mtDNA mutations in deafness . 	2007	2007-07-20	European journal of human genetics : EJHG;2007 Nov;15;11;1145-55;	L√©v√™que,Marianne,M;Marlin,Sandrine,S;Jonard,Laurence,L;Procaccio,Vincent,V;Reynier,Pascal,P;Amati-Bonneau,Patrizia,P;Baulande,Sylvain,S;Pierron,Denis,D;Lacombe,Didier,D;Duriez,Fran√ßoise,F;Francannet,Christine,C;Mom,Thierry,T;Journel,Hubert,H;Catros,H√	-1.38872
ERROR 17176575: 17665455	Association of arthritis with a gene complex encoding C-type lectin-like receptors . 	OBJECTIVE : To identify susceptibility genes in a rat model of rheumatoid arthritis and to determine whether the corresponding human genes are associated with RA . METHODS : Genes influencing oil-induced arthritis were position mapped by comparing the susceptibility of inbred DA rats with that of DA rats carrying alleles derived from the arthritis-resistant PVG strain in chromosomal fragments overlapping the quantitative trait locus Oia2 . Sequencing of gene complementary DNA and analysis of gene messenger RNA expression were performed to attempt to clone a causal gene . Associations with human RA were evaluated by genotyping single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the corresponding human genes and by analyzing frequencies of alleles and haplotypes in RA patients and age- , sex- , and area-matched healthy control subjects . RESULTS : Congenic DA rats were resistant to OIA when they carried PVG alleles for the antigen-presenting lectin-like receptor gene complex , which encodes immunoregulatory C-type lectin-like receptors . Multiple differences in cDNA sequence and mRNA expression precluded cloning of a single causal gene . Five corresponding human APLEC genes were identified and targeted . The SNP rs1133104 in the dendritic cell immunoreceptor gene , and a haplotype including that marker and 4 other SNPs in DCIR and its vicinity showed an indication of allelic association with susceptibility to RA in patients who were negative for antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide , with respective odds ratios of 1.27 and 1.37 . Results of permutation testing supported this association of the haplotype with RA . CONCLUSION : Rat APLEC is associated with susceptibility to polyarthritis , and human APLEC and DCIR may be associated with susceptibility to anti-CCP-negative RA . 	2007	2007-08-01	Arthritis and rheumatism;2007 Aug;56;8;2620-32;	Lorentzen,Johnny C,JC;Flornes,Line,L;Ekl√∂w,Carina,C;B√§ckdahl,Liselotte,L;Ribbhammar,Ulrica,U;Guo,Jian Ping,JP;Smolnikova,Marina,M;Dissen,Erik,E;Seddighzadeh,Maria,M;Brookes,Anthony J,AJ;Alfredsson,Lars,L;Klareskog,Lars,L;Padyukov,Leonid,L;Fossum,Sigbj√	-0.831792

Activating mutations of the p110 alpha subunit of PI3K oncogene have been identified in a broad spectrum of malignant tumors . However , their role in benign or preneoplastic conditions is unknown . Activating FGF receptor 3 mutations are common in benign skin lesions , either as embryonic mutations in epidermal nevi or as somatic mutations in seborrheic keratoses . FGFR3 mutations are also common in low-grade malignant bladder tumors , where they often occur in association with PIK3CA mutations . Therefore , we examined exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA and FGFR3 hotspot mutations in EN and SK , two proliferative skin lesions lacking malignant potential . Nine of 33 EN harbored PIK3CA mutations ; all cases showed the E545G substitution , which is uncommon in cancers . In EN , R248C was the only FGFR3 mutation identified . By contrast , 10 of 62 SK revealed the typical cancer-associated PIK3CA mutations E542K , E545K , and H1047R . The same lesions displayed a wide range of FGFR3 mutations . Corresponding unaffected tissue was available for four EN and two mutant SK : all control samples displayed a WT sequence , confirming the somatic nature of the mutations found in lesional tissue . Forty of 95 lesions showed at least one mutation in either gene . PIK3CA and FGFR3 mutations displayed an independent distribution ; 5 / 95 lesions harbored mutations in both genes . Our findings suggest that , in addition to their role in cancer , oncogenic PIK3CA mutations contribute to the pathogenesis of skin tumors lacking malignant potential . The remarkable genotype-phenotype correlation as observed in this study points to a distinct etiopathogenesis of the mutations in keratinocytes occuring either during fetal development or in adult life . 	2007	2007-08-04	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America;2007 Aug 14;104;33;13450-4;	Hafner,Christian,C;L√≥pez-Knowles,Elena,E;Luis,Nuno M,NM;Toll,Agust√≠,A;Baselga,Eul√†lia,E;Fern√°ndez-Casado,Alex,A;Hern√°ndez,Silvia,S;Rib√©,Adriana,A;Mentzel,Thomas,T;Stoehr,Robert,R;Hofstaedter,Ferdinand,F;Landthaler,Michael,M;Vogt,Thomas,T;Pujol,Ram√	-0.907061

BACKGROUND : The extent to which moderate overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease through adverse effects on blood pressure and cholesterol levels is unclear , as is the risk of CHD that remains after these mediating effects are considered . METHODS : Relative risks of CHD associated with moderate overweight and obesity with and without adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol concentrations were calculated by the members of a collaboration of prospective cohort studies of healthy , mainly white persons and pooled by means of random-effects models . RESULTS : A total of 18 000 CHD events occurred during follow-up . The age- , sex- , physical activity- , and smoking-adjusted RRs for moderate overweight and obesity compared with normal weight were 1.32 and 1.81 , respectively . Additional adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol levels reduced the RR to 1.17 for moderate overweight and to 1.49 for obesity . The RR associated with a 5-unit BMI increment was 1.29 before and 1.16 after adjustment for blood pressure and cholesterol levels . CONCLUSIONS : Adverse effects of overweight on blood pressure and cholesterol levels could account for about 45 % of the increased risk of CHD . Even for moderate overweight , there is a significant increased risk of CHD independent of these traditional risk factors , although confounding can not be completely ruled out . 	2007	2007-09-12	Archives of internal medicine;2007 Sep 10;167;16;1720-8;	Bogers,Rik P,RP;Bemelmans,Wanda J E,WJ;Hoogenveen,Rudolf T,RT;Boshuizen,Hendriek C,HC;Woodward,Mark,M;Knekt,Paul,P;van Dam,Rob M,RM;Hu,Frank B,FB;Visscher,Tommy L S,TL;Menotti,Alessandro,A;Thorpe,Roland J,RJ;Jamrozik,Konrad,K;Calling,Susanna,S;Strand,Bj√	-0.967417

BACKGROUND : Family , twin and molecular studies provide increasing evidence for the importance of genetic factors in obsessive-compulsive disorder . Recent work suggests that brain-derived neurotrophic factor may be involved in OCD pathophysiology . We used a linkage disequilibrium -mapping approach to investigate the role that BDNF and its specific receptor neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 2 may play in increasing susceptibility to OCD . METHODS : Eight tag single nucleotide polymorphisms covering the BDNF gene region and 46 tagSNPs in the NTRK2 region were genotyped in 215 OCD patients and 342 control subjects . Single nucleotide polymorphism association and haplotype analysis were performed . The possible relationship between genetic factors and clinical characteristics including age of OCD onset , tic disorders , clinical dimensions , and family history of OCD were investigated . RESULTS : Haplotype analysis revealed a significant association between OCD and a five-marker protective haplotype located toward the 5 &apos; of the BDNF gene containing the functional valine 66-to-methionine variant . A significant association between a NTRK2 intronic SNP and OCD was identified in female patients under an additive model . A protective haplotype located in intron 19 of NTRK2 was also associated with OCD . CONCLUSIONS : These findings support a role for the BDNF / NTRK2 signaling pathway in genetic susceptibility to OCD . 	2007	2007-09-22	Biological psychiatry;2008 Mar 15;63;6;619-28;	Alonso,Pino,P;Gratac√≤s,M√≥nica,M;Mench√≥n,Jos√© M,JM;Saiz-Ruiz,Jer√≥nimo,J;Segal√†s,Cinto,C;Baca-Garc√≠a,Enrique,E;Labad,Javier,J;Fern√°ndez-Piqueras,Jos√©,J;Real,Eva,E;Vaquero,Concepci√≥n,C;P√©rez,Mercedes,M;Dolengevich,Helen,H;Gonz√°lez,Juan R,JR;Bay√	-0.958213

It is estimated that 15 % of the diabetic population will develop an ulcer sometime in their lives . Although novel therapies have been proposed , there is no effective treatment for this pathology . Naturally produced nitric oxide participates in the wound healing process by stimulating the synthesis of collagen , triggering the release of chemotactic cytokines , increasing blood vessels permeability , promoting angiogenic activity , stimulating the release of epidermical growth factors , and by interfering with the bacterial mitochondrial respiratory chain . Topically administered nitric oxide has demonstrated to be effective and safe for the treatment of chronic ulcers secondary to cutaneous leishmaniasis . However , due to their unstable nitric oxide release , the topical donors needed to be applied frequently , diminishing the adherence to the treatment . This difficulty has led to the development of a multilayer polymeric transdermal patch produced by electrospinning technique that guarantees a constant nitric oxide release . The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this novel nitric oxide releasing wound dressing for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers . METHODS AND DESIGN : A double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial , including 100 diabetic patients was designed . At the time of enrollment , a complete medical evaluation and laboratory tests will be performed , and those patients who meet the inclusion criteria randomly assigned to one of two groups . Over the course of 90 days group 1 will receive active patches and group 2 placebo patches . The patients will be seen by the research group at least every two weeks until the healing of the ulcer or the end of the treatment . During each visit the healing process of the ulcer , the patient &apos; s health status and the presence of adverse events will be assessed . Should the effectiveness of the patches be demonstrated an alternative treatment would then be available to patients .

ERROR 17421063: 17921183	Recommendations for the content and conduct of European League Against Rheumatism musculoskeletal ultrasound courses . 	OBJECTIVE : To develop education guidelines for the conduct of future European League Against Rheumatism musculoskeletal ultrasound courses . METHODS : We undertook a consensus-based , iterative process using two consecutive questionnaires sent to 29 senior ultrasonographer rheumatologists who comprised the faculty of the 14th EULAR ultrasound course . The first questionnaire encompassed the following issues : type of MSUS educational model ; course timing ; course curriculum ; course duration ; number of participants per teacher in practical sessions ; time spent on hands-on sessions ; and the requirements and/or restrictions for attendance at the courses . The second questionnaire consisted of questions related to areas where consensus had not been achieved in the first questionnaire , and to the topics and pathologies to be assigned to different educational levels . RESULTS : The response rate was 82.7 % from the first questionnaire and 87.5 % from the second questionnaire . The respondents were from 11 European countries . The group consensus on guidelines and curriculum was for a three-level education model with timing and location related to the annual EULAR Congresses . The topics and pathologies to be included in each course were agreed . The course duration will be 20 h . There will be a maximum of six participants per teacher and 50-60 % of total time will be spent on practical sessions . There was also agreement on prerequisite experience before attending the intermediate and advanced courses . CONCLUSION : We have developed European agreed guidelines for the content and conduct of EULAR ultrasound courses , which may also be recommended to national and local MSUS training programmes . 	2007	2007-10-09	Annals of the rheumatic diseases;2008 Jul;67;7;1017-22;	Naredo,E,E;Bijlsma,J W J,JW;Conaghan,P G,PG;Acebes,C,C;Balint,P,P;Berner-Hammer,H,H;Bruyn,G A W,GA;Collado,P,P;D&apos;Agostino,M A,MA;de Agustin,J J,JJ;de Miguel,E,E;Filippucci,E,E;Grassi,W,W;Iagnocco,A,A;Kane,D,D;Koski,J M,JM;Manger,B,B;Mayordomo,L,L;M√	-1.31254

The cytokine BAFF binds to the receptors TACI , BCMA , and BAFF-R on B cells , whereas APRIL binds to TACI and BCMA only . The signaling properties of soluble trimeric BAFF were compared with those of higher-order BAFF oligomers . All forms of BAFF bound BAFF-R and TACI , and elicited BAFF-R-dependent signals in primary B cells . In contrast , signaling through TACI in mature B cells or plasmablasts was only achieved by higher-order BAFF and APRIL oligomers , all of which were also po-tent activators of a multimerization-dependent reporter signaling pathway . These results indicate that , although BAFF-R and TACI can provide B cells with similar signals , only BAFF-R , but not TACI , can respond to soluble BAFF 3-mer , which is the main form of BAFF found in circulation . BAFF 60-mer , an efficient TACI agonist , was also detected in plasma of BAFF transgenic and nontransgenic mice and was more than 100-fold more active than BAFF 3-mer for the activation of multimerization-dependent signals .

ERROR 17478000: 17981317	Asthma control in Europe : a real-world evaluation based on an international population-based study . 	BACKGROUND : Epidemiologic evidence related to asthma control in patients from the general population is scanty . OBJECTIVES : We sought to assess asthma control in several European centers according to the Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines and to investigate its determinants . METHODS : In the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II , 1241 adults with asthma were identified and classified into inhaled corticosteroid users and non-ICS users in the last year . Control was assessed in both groups by using the GINA proposal , and it was related to potential determinants . RESULTS : Only 15 % of subjects who had used ICSs in the last year and 45 % of non-ICS users had their asthma under control ; individuals with uncontrolled asthma accounted for 49 % and 18 % , respectively . Among ICS users , the prevalence of uncontrolled asthma showed great variability across Europe , ranging from 20 % to 67 % . Overweight status , chronic cough and phlegm , and sensitization to Cladosporium species were associated with poor control in ICS users . About 65 % and 87 % of ICS users with uncontrolled and partly controlled asthma , respectively , were on a medication regimen that was less than recommended by the GINA guidelines . CONCLUSION : Six of 7 European asthmatic adults using ICSs in the last year did not achieve good disease control . The large majority of subjects with poorly controlled asthma were using antiasthma drugs in a suboptimal way . A wide variability in asthma control emerged across Europe . CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS : Greater attention should be paid to asthma management and to the implementation of the GINA guidelines . 	2007	2007-11-06	The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology;2007 Dec;120;6;1360-7;	Cazzoletti,Lucia,L;Marcon,Alessandro,A;Janson,Christer,C;Corsico,Angelo,A;Jarvis,Deborah,D;Pin,Isabelle,I;Accordini,Simone,S;Almar,Enrique,E;Bugiani,Massimiliano,M;Carolei,Adriana,A;Cerveri,Isa,I;Duran-Tauleria,Enric,E;Gislason,David,D;Gulsvik,Amund,A;J√	-1.40281

The presence of circulating villous lymphocytes in lymphoma patients usually points to splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma , even if the VLs can be found occasionally in other small B-cell lymphomas . However , those cells are variably described , and detailed cytologic characterization is often lacking . We identified lymphoma cases with numerous basophilic VLs among the large group of splenic lymphoma with VLs , and for further delineation , 37 cases with this particular cytology were analyzed . Patients , predominantly older men , presented with moderate lymphocytosis and splenomegaly without pancytopenia . The monoclonal B cells expressed IgM + D , IgM + G , IgM or IgG , as well as CD76 and CD11c , frequently CD103 , and rarely CD123 . Spleen sections were peculiar , with atrophic white pulp and a monomorphic diffuse lymphoma infiltration in a congested red pulp . Bone marrow infiltration was interstitial and intrasinusoidal without extensive fibrosis . Cytogenetic analysis showed a frequent absence of clonal aberrations . Most cases were IgH mutated , with an overrepresentation of V3 and V4 gene families .

ERROR 17588958: 18098182	Novel paclitaxel-eluting , biodegradable polymer coated stent in the treatment of de novo coronary lesions : a prospective multicenter registry . 	OBJECTIVES : The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a biodegradable polymer coated , paclitaxel eluting stent based on 9-months angiographic and 12-months clinical follow-up results . BACKGROUND : First-generation drug-eluting stents utilize nonbioabsorbable polymeric coatings , whose persistent presence in the arterial wall may negatively affect long-term outcomes . Bioabsorbable coatings with a degradation period matched to that of the drug elution may be a better alternative , clinically and economically . METHODS : We conducted a prospective , multicenter first-in-man registry of a novel , locally developed , bioabsorbable-coated , paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent in 116 patients with single-lesion de novo coronary disease . RESULTS : Major adverse cardiac events occurred in 7.8 % patients within 12 months . There were no late thrombotic events , death , stroke , or surgical revascularization in that period . There were two myocardial infarctions , one related to recent subacute stent thrombosis and another associated with restenosis . By 12 months , target vessel revascularization was performed in 7.8 % ; 2.9 % were ischemia-driven and the rest were mandated at 9 months in accordance with a control angiography protocol . Core-lab assessed binary in-stent restenosis was noted in 11.9 % patients and mean late loss was 0.46 +/- 0.47 mm. CONCLUSIONS : This first-in-man experience obtained in a multicenter registry of real-world de novo lesions showed a favorable safety profile and acceptable efficacy through 12 months . Randomized comparison with a benchmark nonbioabsorbable polymer coated paclitaxel eluting stent should be undertaken to validate this initial positive experience . 	2007	2007-12-22	Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography &amp; Interventions;2008 Jan 1;71;1;51-7;	Buszman,Pawe≈Ç,P;Trznadel,Stanis≈Çaw,S;Milewski,Krzysztof,K;Rze≈∫niczak,Janusz,J;Przew≈Çocki,Tadeusz,T;Ko≈õmider,Maciej,M;W√≥jcik,Jaroslaw,J;Janczak,Jacek,J;Zurakowski,Aleksander,A;Kondys,Marek,M;Kr√≥l,Marek,M;Kinasz,Leszek,L;Jaklik,Andrzej,A;Rzeszutko,≈	-1.02775

PURPOSE : Fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , and mitoxantrone results in a high response rate in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia . The aim of this study was to investigate FCM as frontline therapy in CLL . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Sixty-nine patients under the age of 65 years with active CLL were treated . Patients received six cycles of fludarabine 25 mg / m i.v. x 3 days , cyclophosphamide 200 mg / m i.v. x 3 days , and mitoxantrone 6 mg / m i.v. x 1 day . Treatment outcome was correlated with clinical and biological variables . The clinical significance of eradicating minimal residual disease was also analyzed . RESULTS : The overall response , MRD-negative complete response , MRD-positive CR , nodular partial response , and PR rates were 90 % , 26 % , 38 % , 14 % , and 12 % , respectively . Severe neutropenia developed in 10 % of the patients . Major and minor infections were reported in 1 % and 8 % of cases , respectively . Median response duration was 37 months . Patients with del failed to attain CR . Patients achieving MRD-negative CR had a longer response duration and overall survival than patients with an inferior response . Low serum lactate dehydrogenase levels , low ZAP-70 expression , and mutated IgV genes predicted longer response duration . Finally , both low ZAP-70 and CD38 expression in leukemic cells correlated with MRD-negativity achievement . CONCLUSION : FCM induces a high response rate , including MRD-negative CRs in untreated patients with active CLL . Treatment toxicity is acceptable . Both high ZAP-70 and increased CD38 expression predict failure to obtain MRD-negative response . Patients in whom MRD can be eradicated have longer response duration and overall survival than those with inferior response .

BACKGROUND : Determinants of one-carbon metabolism , such as folate and vitamin B , have been implicated in cancer development . Previous studies have not provided conclusive evidence for the importance of circulating concentrations of folate and vitamin B in prostate cancer etiology . The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between prostate cancer risk and circulating concentrations of folate and vitamin B in a large prospective cohort . METHODS : We analyzed circulating concentrations of folate and vitamin B in 869 cases and 1,174 controls , individually matched on center , age , and date of recruitment , nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort . Relative risks for prostate cancer were estimated using conditional logistic regression models . RESULTS : Overall , no significant associations were observed for circulating concentrations of folate or vitamin B with prostate cancer risk . RRs for a doubling in folate and vitamin B concentrations were 1.03 and 1.12 , respectively . In the subgroup of cases diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer , elevated concentrations of vitamin B were associated with increased risk . No other subgroup analyses resulted in a statistically significant association . CONCLUSION : This study does not provide strong support for an association between prostate cancer risk and circulating concentrations of folate or vitamin B . Elevated concentrations of vitamin B may be associated with an increased risk for advanced stage prostate cancer , but this association requires examination in other large prospective studies . 	2008	2008-02-13	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers &amp; prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology;2008 Feb;17;2;279-85;	Johansson,Mattias,M;Appleby,Paul N,PN;Allen,Naomi E,NE;Travis,Ruth C,RC;Roddam,Andrew W,AW;Egevad,Lars,L;Jenab,Mazda,M;Rinaldi,Sabina,S;Kiemeney,Lambertus A,LA;Bueno-de-Mesquita,H Bas,HB;Vollset,Stein Emil,SE;Ueland,Per M,PM;S√°nchez,Maria-Jos√©,MJ;Quir√	-1.15942

OBJECTIVES : To analyze the survival rate in a series of patients with the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma over a 19 year period based on prognostic factors usually employed in clinical practice . METHODS : Retrospective study of 259 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma undergoing surgery in our department between 1988 and 2006 . From clinical , pathological , and follow-up data we performed a survival study comparing the impact of usual prognostic factors : stage , tumor size , nuclear grade , etc. RESULTS : 264 surgical procedures were performed in 259 patients , with a mean age of 6 1.91 yr. The most frequent way of diagnosis was incidental finding ; radical nephrectomy was performed in 72.97 % of the cases in comparison with 26.25 % partial nephrectomies . Clear cell carcinoma was the most frequent histological diagnosis . Patients with clear cell carcinoma , symptomatic tumors , bigger size , and greater Fuhrman nuclear grade presented worse survivals , mainly in tumors with stage &gt; pT3a . The presence of involved lymph nodes or distant metastases is associated with a much lower cancer-specific survival . Global five-year cancer-specific survival was over 80 % . CONCLUSIONS : The classical prognostic factors used to predict survival in renal cancer are still useful , mainly pathological stage pT . We observed a better survival in comparison with older series , but this kind of tumors continue generating important morbidity-mortality . 	2008	2008-02-15	Archivos espa√±oles de urolog√≠a;2007 Dec;60;10;1.167-1.174;	Gim√©nez Bachs,Jos√© Miguel,JM;Donate Moreno,Ma Jos√©,MJ;Salinas S√°nchez,Antonio S,AS;Pastor Navarro,H√©ctor,H;Carri√≥n L√≥pez,Pedro,P;Pastor Guzm√°n,Jos√© Mar√≠a,JM;Polo Ru√≠z,Lorenzo,L;Mart√≠nez Mart√≠n,Mariano,M;Ru√≠z Mond√©jar,Rafael,R;Virseda Rodr√	-1.19164
ERROR 17823846: 18343769	. 	BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Amputation is the only current option for relief of rest pain or gangrene in patients with severe peripheral arterial disease . Up to now , no effective blood-flow enhancement therapies are available . Autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell transplantation is an arising therapy modality with an option of building new blood vessels through endothelial stem and/or progenitor cells . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Five patients with severe peripheral arterial disorder were treated by autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy . CD34+ , CD133+ and CD45 +/- cell number and ratio were determined . CD34+ cells were isolated by magnetic separation and collected into a 10 ml sample . The cell suspension was administered by local intramuscular injections . The follow-up based on clinical and laboratory parameters was documented and analyzed . RESULTS : Improvement of pain and walking distance was observed in all five cases . In three cases the non-healing ischaemic ulcers disappeared , in one other case they became smaller and thinner , and in one case no change was realized . The average of ankle-brachial index improved significantly . New collaterals were detected by angiography in three patients , but duplex ultrasonography detected improvement in one patient only . Before and 1 , 6 and 12 months after stem cell therapy the transcutaneous oxygen tension changed on the foot from 18.80 / 16.78 / 23.83 / 37.50 mmHg , and on the calf from 36.66 / 31.25 / 45.00 / 37.30 mmHg . The macro- and microcirculation parameters did not show improvement after 1 month , however , after 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 months improved parameters were recorded . Severe adverse events were not observed . In one case elevated level of serum creatinine phosphokinase , and in another case a mild form of vasculitis were detected . CONCLUSION : autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell therapy with isolated CD34+ cells is effective , safe and results in sustained clinical benefit for patients with severe peripheral arterial disease . 	2008	2008-03-18	Orvosi hetilap;2008 Mar 23;149;12;531-40;	Boda,Zolt√°n,Z;Udvardy,Mikl√≥s,M;Farkas,Katalin,K;T√≥th,Judit,J;J√°mbor,L√°szl√≥,L;Solt√©sz,P√°l,P;R√°zs√≥,Katalin,K;Ol√°h,Zsolt,Z;Ilonczai,P√©ter,P;Szarvas,Mariann,M;Litauszky,Krisztina,K;Hunyadi,J√°nos,J;Sipos,Tam√°s,T;Kappelmayer,J√°nos,J;Ver√©b,Zolt√	-1.42637
ERROR 17824215: 18344153	Short- and long-term mortality in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated with different therapeutic strategies . Results from WIelkopolska REgional 2002 Registry . 	BACKGROUND : Although primary coronary angioplasty seems to be the best treatment in acute myocardial infarction , thrombolytic therapy still remains the most common reperfusion strategy particularly in smaller centers . Nowadays , different regional networks are developed to improve the treatment of patients with MI . AIM : To analyse the effects of different therapeutic strategies on 30-day and long-term mortality after ST-elevation MI in a population of 3 350 000 people from the Wielkopolska Region . METHODS : In 2002 , 3780 patients with STEMI entered the registry . Complete data were available for 3564 patients . Depending on therapeutic strategies , patients were divided into five groups : the PCI group -- direct percutaneous coronary angioplasty in small cathlab , &apos; selected patients &apos; , n=381 ; the PA group -- aged &lt; 70 , treated with tissue plasminogen activator up to 4 hours from the onset of chest pain , n=479 ; the IS group - invasive strategy in every patient , 24-hour duty , setting of unselected patients with STEMI , n=989 ; the SK group -- patients receiving standard streptokinase treatment up to 12 hours from the onset of chest pain , n=584 ; the NR group -- no reperfusion therapy , n=1131 . RESULTS : The 30-day mortality rate in the groups above was : 3.15 , 4.38 , 4.54 , 9.25 , and 12.5 % respectively . Long-term mortality rate was : 4.2 , 9.4 , 9.4 , 14.4 , and 18.50 % respectively . The rate of urgent PCI in the PA group was 25 % and in the SK group -- 11 % . CONCLUSIONS : Treatment with rt-PA in patients under 70 years of age and up to 4 hours from pain onset may be an alternative to an invasive strategy . However , a quarter of those patients require urgent PCI . In long-term observation the mortality benefit can be clearly seen only in patients with early PCI . 	2008	2008-03-18	Kardiologia polska;2008 Feb;66;2;154-63; discussion 164-5;	Grajek,Stefan,S;Lesiak,Maciej,M;Araszkiewicz,Aleksander,A;Pyda,Ma≈Çgorzata,M;Skorupski,W≈Çodzimierz,W;Grygier,Marek,M;Mitkowski,Przemys≈Çaw,P;Prech,Marek,M;Baszko,Artur,A;Janus,Magdalena,M;Breborowicz,Piotr,P;Rze≈∫niczak,Janusz,J;Tarchalski,Janusz,J;G≈Ç√	-1.31165

OBJECTIVE : To assess and compare the burnout level between Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Unit , and study its association with the sociodemographic and work characteristics of the professionals surveyed . DESCRIPTION : Cross-sectional , descriptive study . Emplacement . Intensive Care Unit of the university hospital Morales Meseguer , Murcia-Spain . STUDIED SAMPLE : 97 nursing professionals : 55 professionals belong to the Emergency Department , and 42 professionals belong to the Intensive Care Department . METHOD : Two evaluation tools were used : a sociodemographic and work survey , and the Maslach Burnout Inventory , 1986 . Quantitative variables expressed as mean +/- SD compared with the Student &apos; s T test and qualitative variables compared with the chi2 test . Statistical analysis : SPSS 12.0 . RESULTS : The comparative analysis of the burnout dimensions shows that emotional exhaustion level is significantly higher in the intensive care service than in the emergency one p &lt; 0.05 . The rest of burnout dimensions do not show significant differences between both departments . The masculine gender obtains a higher score in the depersonalization dimension of burnout than female one p &lt; 0.01 . There is greater vulnerability to emotional exhaustion among the professional group with more than 15 years of work experience . CONCLUSIONS : The burnout levels are moderate to high among the nursing professionals studied . A total of 5.15 % of the sample studied achieves a high score in the three dimensions of the burnout syndrome . The intensive care professionals are the most vulnerable to suffering high levels of emotional exhaustion , and the masculine gender is more susceptible to depersonalization attitudes . 	2008	2008-03-25	Enfermer√≠a intensiva / Sociedad Espa√±ola de Enfermer√≠a Intensiva y Unidades Coronarias;2008 Jan-Mar;19;1;2-13;	R√≠os Risquez,M I,MI;Godoy Fern√°ndez,C,C;Pe√±alver Hern√°ndez,F,F;Alonso Tovar,A R,AR;L√≥pez Alcaraz,F,F;L√≥pez Romera,A,A;Garn√©s Gonz√°lez,S,S;Salmer√≥n Saura,E,E;L√≥pez Real,M D,MD;Ruiz S√°nchez,R,R;Sim√≥n Domingo,P,P;Manzanera Nicol√°s,J L,JL;Mench√	-1.10823
ERROR 17845548: 18366642	The CoLaus study : a population-based study to investigate the epidemiology and genetic determinants of cardiovascular risk factors and metabolic syndrome . 	BACKGROUND : Cardiovascular diseases and their associated risk factors remain the main cause of mortality in western societies . In order to assess the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the Caucasian population of Lausanne , Switzerland , we conducted a population-based study . A secondary aim of the CoLaus study will be to determine new genetic determinants associated with CVRFs . METHODS : Single-center , cross-sectional study including a random sample of 6,188 extensively phenotyped Caucasian subjects aged 35 to 75 years living in Lausanne , and genotyped using the 500 K Affymetrix chip technology . RESULTS : Obesity , smoking , hypertension , dyslipidemia and diabetes were present in 947 , 1673 , 2268 , 2113 and 407 of the participants , respectively , and the prevalence was higher in men than in women . In both genders , the prevalence of obesity , hypertension and diabetes increased with age . CONCLUSION : The prevalence of major CVRFs is high in the Lausanne population in particular in men . We anticipate that given its size , the depth of the phenotypic analysis and the availability of dense genome-wide genetic data , the CoLaus Study will be a unique resource to investigate not only the epidemiology of isolated , or aggregated CVRFs like the metabolic syndrome , but can also serve as a discovery set , as well as replication set , to identify novel genes associated with these conditions . 	2008	2008-03-28	BMC cardiovascular disorders;2008;8;;6;	Firmann,Mathieu,M;Mayor,Vladimir,V;Vidal,Pedro Marques,PM;Bochud,Murielle,M;P√©coud,Alain,A;Hayoz,Daniel,D;Paccaud,Fred,F;Preisig,Martin,M;Song,Kijoung S,KS;Yuan,Xin,X;Danoff,Theodore M,TM;Stirnadel,Heide A,HA;Waterworth,Dawn,D;Mooser,Vincent,V;Waeber,G√	-1.43514
ERROR 17872981: 18395579	Efficacy and safety of an oral live attenuated human rotavirus vaccine against rotavirus gastroenteritis during the first 2 years of life in Latin American infants : a randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase III study . 	BACKGROUND : Peak incidence of rotavirus gastroenteritis is seen in infants between 6 and 24 months of age . We therefore aimed to assess the 2-year efficacy and safety of an oral live attenuated human rotavirus vaccine for prevention of severe gastroenteritis in infants . METHODS : 15 183 healthy infants aged 6-13 weeks from ten Latin American countries randomly assigned in a 1 to 1 ratio to receive two oral doses of RIX4414 or placebo at about 2 and 4 months of age in a double-blind , placebo-controlled phase III study were followed up until about 2 years of age . Primary endpoint was vaccine efficacy from 2 weeks after dose two until 1 year of age . Treatment allocation was concealed from investigators and parents of participating infants . Efficacy follow-up for gastroenteritis episodes was undertaken from 2 weeks after dose two until about 2 years of age . Analysis was according to protocol . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00140673 . FINDINGS : 897 infants were excluded from the according-to-protocol analysis . Fewer cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis were recorded for the combined 2-year period in the RIX4414 group than in the placebo group , resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 80.5 % to 82.1 % against wild-type G1 , 77.5 % against pooled non-G1 strains , and 80.5 % against pooled non-G1 P strains . Vaccine efficacy for hospital admission for rotavirus gastroenteritis was 83.0 % and for admission for diarrhoea of any cause was 39.3 % . No cases of intussusception were reported during the second year of follow-up . INTERPRETATION : Two doses of RIX4414 were effective against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis during the first 2 years of life in a Latin American setting . Inclusion of RIX4414 in routine paediatric immunisations should reduce the burden of rotavirus gastroenteritis worldwide . 	2008	2008-04-09	Lancet;2008 Apr 5;371;9619;1181-9;	Linhares,Alexandre C,AC;Vel√°zquez,F Ra√∫l,FR;P√©rez-Schael,Irene,I;S√°ez-Llorens,Xavier,X;Abate,Hector,H;Espinoza,Felix,F;L√≥pez,P√≠o,P;Mac√≠as-Parra,Mercedes,M;Ortega-Barr√≠a,Eduardo,E;Rivera-Medina,Doris Maribel,DM;Rivera,Luis,L;Pav√≠a-Ruz,Noris,N;Nu√	-1.29258
ERROR 17875730: 18398482	The role of the iron transporter ABCB7 in refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts . 	Refractory Anemia with Ring Sideroblasts is an acquired myelodysplastic syndrome characterized by an excess iron accumulation in the mitochondria of erythroblasts . The pathogenesis of RARS and the cause of this unusual pattern of iron deposition remain unknown . We considered that the inherited X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia might be informative for the acquired disorder , RARS . XLSA / A is caused by partial inactivating mutations of the ABCB7 ATP-binding cassette transporter gene , which functions to enable transport of iron from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm . Furthermore , ABCB7 gene silencing in HeLa cells causes an accumulation of iron in the mitochondria . We have studied the role of ABCB7 in RARS by DNA sequencing , methylation studies , and gene expression studies in primary CD34 cells and in cultured erythroblasts . The DNA sequence of the ABCB7 gene is normal in patients with RARS . We have investigated ABCB7 gene expression levels in the CD34 cells of 122 MDS cases , comprising 35 patients with refractory anemia , 33 patients with RARS and 54 patients with RA with excess blasts , and in the CD34 cells of 16 healthy controls . We found that the expression levels of ABCB7 are significantly lower in the RARS group . RARS is thus characterized by lower levels of ABCB7 gene expression in comparison to other MDS subtypes . Moreover , we find a strong relationship between increasing percentage of bone marrow ring sideroblasts and decreasing ABCB7 gene expression levels . Erythroblast cell cultures confirm the low levels of ABCB7 gene expression levels in RARS . These data provide an important link between inherited and acquired forms of sideroblastic anemia and indicate that ABCB7 is a strong candidate gene for RARS . 	2008	2008-04-10	PloS one;2008;3;4;e1970;	Boultwood,Jacqueline,J;Pellagatti,Andrea,A;Nikpour,Maryam,M;Pushkaran,Beena,B;Fidler,Carrie,C;Cattan,Helen,H;Littlewood,Tim J,TJ;Malcovati,Luca,L;Della Porta,Matteo G,MG;J√§dersten,Martin,M;Killick,Sally,S;Giagounidis,Aristoteles,A;Bowen,David,D;Hellstr√	-0.921382

In this article , we reinvestigated qualitative and quantitative aspects of plant N-glycan profiling . The extraction of plant proteins through a phenol / ammonium acetate procedure followed by deglycosylation with peptide N-glycosidase A and coupling to 2-aminobenzamide provides an oligosaccharide preparation containing reduced amounts of contaminants from plant cell wall polysaccharides . Such a preparation was also suitable for accurate qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the N-glycan content by mass spectrometry . Combining these approaches allows the profiling to be carried out from as low as 500 mg of fresh leaf material . We also demonstrated that collision-induced dissociation mass spectrometry in negative mode of N-glycans harboring alpha- or alpha-fucose residue on the proximal GlcNAc leads to specific fragmentation patterns , thereby allowing the discrimination of plant N-glycans from those arising from mammalian contamination . 	2008	2008-05-17	Analytical biochemistry;2008 Aug 1;379;1;66-72;	S√©veno,Martial,M;Cabrera,Gleysin,G;Triguero,Ada,A;Burel,Carole,C;Leprince,J√©rome,J;Rihouey,Christophe,C;V√©zina,Louis-Philippe,LP;D&apos;Aoust,Marc-Andr√©,MA;Rudd,Pauline M,PM;Royle,L,L;Dwek,Raymond A,RA;Harvey,David J,DJ;Lerouge,Patrice,P;Cremata,Jos√	-1.37857

BACKGROUND : Aging of the population represents one of the main challenges for health systems because of the increase in the demand for hospital services . To be able to count on tools that allow an objective evaluation of hospital-resource use becomes indispensable for health systems . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol regarding the appropriateness of admissions and hospital stays in elderly patients . In a scenario of scarce resources , to have a valid instrument will make it possible to evaluate the process of care in our growing elderly population in a standardized way . METHODS : We carried out a retrospective study of 144 randomly chosen elderly patients admitted to the hospital with 394 even-numbered hospital-stay days . For the reliability analysis between the pair of nurses with the AEP and the pair of specialists , the details of the hospital admissions and the stay days were obtained from the clinical files . Criteria validity was conducted by pairs of physicians , including two internists , two general surgeons and two geriatricians . Only the agreements were compared with agreements of the AEP-trained nurses . Disagreements were excluded from the final analysis . RESULTS : Inter-rater agreement of hospital admissions and days spent by the patient presented a kappa coefficient of &gt; 0.70 , while these admissions and hospital-stay days was &gt; 0.70 . Sensitivity and positive predictor value to detect inappropriate admissions were not calculated because no agreement existed on inappropriate admissions . Specificity and negative predictive value to detect appropriate admission was &gt; 94.0 % and &gt; 98.0 % . Sensitivity and positive predictor value to detect inappropriate hospital-stay days was &gt; 44.0 % and &gt; 10.0 % , while specificity and negative predictor value for detecting appropriate hospital-stay days was &gt; 79.0 % and &gt; 88.0 % .

Retinol-binding protein 4 is an adipocytokine associated with insulin resistance . We tested serum levels of RBP4 to assess its link with steatosis in patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease . Nondiabetic patients with CHC or NAFLD were evaluated by liver biopsy and anthropometric and metabolic measurements , including IR by the homeostasis model assessment . Biopsies were scored by Scheuer classification for CHC , and Kleiner for NAFLD . Steatosis was tested as a continuous variable and graded as absent-mild &lt; 30 % , or moderate-severe &gt; or =30 % . Thirty nondiabetic , nonobese blood donors served as controls . RBP4 levels were measured by a human competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit . Mean values of RBP4 were similar in NAFLD and CHC , and both were significantly higher than in controls . RBP4 was higher in CHC patients with steatosis than in NAFLD . By linear regression , RBP4 was independently linked to steatosis only in CHC , and to elevated body mass index and low grading in NAFLD . By linear regression , steatosis was independently linked to homeostasis model assessment score and high RBP4 in CHC . By logistic regression , RBP4 was the only variable independently associated with moderate-severe steatosis in CHC , whereas waist circumference was associated with moderate-severe steatosis in NAFLD . CONCLUSION : In nondiabetic , nonobese patients with genotype 1 CHC , serum RBP4 levels might be the expression of a virus-linked pathway to steatosis , largely unrelated to IR . 	2008	2008-05-29	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.);2008 Jul;48;1;28-37;	Petta,Salvatore,S;Camm√†,Calogero,C;Di Marco,Vito,V;Alessi,Nicola,N;Barbaria,Francesco,F;Cabibi,Daniela,D;Caldarella,Rosalia,R;Ciminnisi,Stefania,S;Licata,Anna,A;Massenti,Maria Fatima,MF;Mazzola,Alessandra,A;Tarantino,Giuseppe,G;Marchesini,Giulio,G;Crax√	-0.639871

OBJECTIVES : To assess the differences in comorbid lifetime and current substance use between eating disorder patients and healthy controls in five different European countries . METHOD : A total of 1664 participants took part in the present study . ED cases were referred to specialized ED units in five European countries . The ED cases were compared to a balanced control group of 785 healthy individuals . ASSESSMENT : Participants completed the Substance Use Subscale of the Cross Cultural Questionnaire , a measure of lifetime tobacco , alcohol and drug use . In the control group , also the GHQ-28 , the SCID-I interview and the EAT-26 were used . RESULTS : ED patients had higher lifetime and current tobacco and general drug use . The only non-significant result was obtained for lifetime and current alcohol use . Significant differences across ED subdiagnoses and controls also emerged , with BN and AN-BP generally presenting the highest and AN-R and controls the lowest rates .

BACKGROUND : The genetic contribution to stroke is well established but it has proven difficult to identify the genes and the disease-associated alleles mediating this effect , possibly because only nuclear genes have been intensely investigated so far . Mitochondrial DNA has been implicated in several disorders having stroke as one of its clinical manifestations . The aim of this case-control study was to assess the contribution of mtDNA polymorphisms and haplogroups to ischemic stroke risk . METHODS : We genotyped 19 mtDNA single nucleotide polymorphisms defining the major European haplogroups in 534 ischemic stroke patients and 499 controls collected in Portugal , and tested their allelic and haplogroup association with ischemic stroke risk . RESULTS : Haplogroup H1 was found to be significantly less frequent in stroke patients than in controls , when comparing each clade against all other haplogroups pooled together . Conversely , the pre-HV / HV and U mtDNA lineages emerge as potential genetic factors conferring risk for stroke . SNPs m.3010G &gt; A , m.7028C &gt; T and m.11719G &gt; A strongly influence ischemic stroke risk , their allelic state in haplogroup H1 corroborating its protective effect .

CONCLUSIONS : The chromosome 9p21 locus does not influence CAD risk through a mechanism that also affects CIMT or induces early changes in FMD . 	2008	2008-07-05	Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology;2008 Sep;28;9;1679-83;	Samani,Nilesh J,NJ;Raitakari,Olli T,OT;Sipil√§,Kalle,K;Tobin,Martin D,MD;Schunkert,Heribert,H;Juonala,Markus,M;Braund,Peter S,PS;Erdmann,Jeanette,J;Viikari,Jorma,J;Moilanen,Leena,L;Taittonen,Leena,L;Jula,Antti,A;Jokinen,Eero,E;Laitinen,Tomi,T;Hutri-K√§h√	-0.846632
ERROR 18091992: 18632656	Breast cancer risk reduction and membrane-bound catechol O-methyltransferase genetic polymorphisms . 	Catechol O-methyltransferase -catalyzed methylation of catecholestrogens has been proposed to play a protective role in estrogen-induced genotoxic carcinogenesis . We have taken a comprehensive approach to test the hypothesis that genetic variation in COMT might influence breast cancer risk . Fifteen COMT single nucleotide polymorphisms selected on the basis of in-depth resequencing of the COMT gene were genotyped in 1,482 DNA samples from a Mayo Clinic breast cancer case control study . Two common SNPs in the distal promoter for membrane-bound COMT , rs2020917 and rs737865 , were associated with breast cancer risk reduction in premenopausal women in the Mayo Clinic study , with allele-specific odds ratios of 0.70 and 0.68 , respectively . These two SNPs were then subjected to functional genomic analysis and were genotyped in an additional 3,683 DNA samples from two independent case control studies . Functional genomic experiments showed that these SNPs could up-regulate transcription and that they altered DNA-protein binding patterns . Furthermore , substrate kinetic and exon array analyses suggested a role for MB-COMT in catecholestrogen inactivation . The GENICA results were similar to the Mayo case control observations , with ORs of 0.85 and 0.85 for the two SNPs . No significant effect was observed in the GESBC study . These studies showed that two SNPs in the COMT distal promoter were associated with breast cancer risk reduction in two of three case control studies , compatible with the results of functional genomic experiments , suggesting a role for MB-COMT in breast cancer risk . 	2008	2008-07-18	Cancer research;2008 Jul 15;68;14;5997-6005;	Ji,Yuan,Y;Olson,Janet,J;Zhang,Jianping,J;Hildebrandt,Michelle,M;Wang,Liewei,L;Ingle,James,J;Fredericksen,Zachary,Z;Sellers,Thomas,T;Miller,William,W;Dixon,J Michael,JM;Brauch,Hiltrud,H;Eichelbaum,Michel,M;Justenhoven,Christina,C;Hamann,Ute,U;Ko,Yon,Y;Br√	-1.00762
ERROR 18100539: 18641652	A cis-acting regulatory mutation causes premature hair graying and susceptibility to melanoma in the horse . 	In horses , graying with age is an autosomal dominant trait associated with a high incidence of melanoma and vitiligo-like depigmentation . Here we show that the Gray phenotype is caused by a 4.6-kb duplication in intron 6 of STX17 that constitutes a cis-acting regulatory mutation . Both STX17 and the neighboring NR4A3 gene are overexpressed in melanomas from Gray horses . Gray horses carrying a loss-of-function mutation in ASIP had a higher incidence of melanoma , implying that increased melanocortin-1 receptor signaling promotes melanoma development in Gray horses . The Gray horse provides a notable example of how humans have cherry-picked mutations with favorable phenotypic effects in domestic animals . 	2008	2008-07-22	Nature genetics;2008 Aug;40;8;1004-9;	Rosengren Pielberg,Gerli,G;Golovko,Anna,A;Sundstr√∂m,Elisabeth,E;Curik,Ino,I;Lennartsson,Johan,J;Seltenhammer,Monika H,MH;Druml,Thomas,T;Binns,Matthew,M;Fitzsimmons,Carolyn,C;Lindgren,Gabriella,G;Sandberg,Kaj,K;Baumung,Roswitha,R;Vetterlein,Monika,M;Str√	-0.368943

Controlled human intervention trials are required to confirm the hypothesis that dietary fat quality may influence insulin action . The aim was to develop a food-exchange model , suitable for use in free-living volunteers , to investigate the effects of four experimental diets distinct in fat quantity and quality : high SFA ; high MUFA and two low-fat diets , one supplemented with 1.24 g EPA and DHA / d . A theoretical food-exchange model was developed . The average quantity of exchangeable fat was calculated as the sum of fat provided by added fats , milk , cheese , biscuits , cakes , buns and pastries using data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of UK adults . Most of the exchangeable fat was replaced by specifically designed study foods . Also critical to the model was the use of carbohydrate exchanges to ensure the diets were isoenergetic . Volunteers from eight centres across Europe completed the dietary intervention . Results indicated that compositional targets were largely achieved with significant differences in fat quantity between the high-fat diets and the low-fat diets and fat quality . In conclusion , a robust , flexible food-exchange model was developed and implemented successfully in the LIPGENE dietary intervention trial . 	2008	2008-08-06	The British journal of nutrition;2009 Mar;101;5;750-9;	Shaw,Danielle I,DI;Tierney,Audrey C,AC;McCarthy,Sinead,S;Upritchard,Jane,J;Vermunt,Susan,S;Gulseth,Hanne L,HL;Drevon,Christian A,CA;Blaak,Ellen E,EE;Saris,Wim H M,WH;Karlstr√∂m,Brita,B;Helal,Olfa,O;Defoort,Catherine,C;Gallego,Raquel,R;L√≥pez-Miranda,Jos√	-1.44076
ERROR 18166790: 18715700	A preoperative prognostic model for patients treated with nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma . 	BACKGROUND : Currently two pretreatment prognostic models with limited accuracy can be used to predict survival in patients with localized renal cell carcinoma . OBJECTIVE : We set out to develop a more accurate pretreatment model for predicting RCC-specific mortality after nephrectomy for all stages of RCC . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : The data originated from a series of prospectively recorded contemporary cases of patients treated with radical or partial nephrectomy between 1984 and 2006 . Model development was performed using data from 2474 patients from five centers and external validation was performed using data from 1972 patients from seven centers . MEASUREMENTS : The probability of RCC-specific mortality was modeled using Cox regression . The significance of the predictors was confirmed using competing risks analyses , which account for mortality from other causes . RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS : Median follow-up in patients who did not die of RCC-specific causes was 4.2 yr and 3.5 yr in the development and validation cohorts , respectively . The freedom from cancer-specific mortality rates in the nomogram development cohort were 75.4 % at 5 yr after nephrectomy and 68.3 % at 10 yr after nephrectomy . All variables except gender achieved independent predictor status . In the external validation cohort the nomogram predictions were 88.1 % accurate at 1 yr , 86.8 % accurate at 2 yr , 86.8 % accurate at 5 yr , and 84.2 % accurate at 10 yr. CONCLUSIONS : Our model substantially exceeds the accuracy of the existing pretreatment models . Consequently , the proposed nomogram-based predictions may be used as benchmark data for pretreatment decision making in patients with various stages of RCC . 	2008	2008-08-22	European urology;2009 Feb;55;2;287-95;	Karakiewicz,Pierre I,PI;Suardi,Nazareno,N;Capitanio,Umberto,U;Jeldres,Claudio,C;Ficarra,Vincenzo,V;Cindolo,Luca,L;de la Taille,Alexandre,A;Tostain,Jacques,J;Mulders,Peter F A,PF;Bensalah,Karim,K;Artibani,Walter,W;Salomon,Laurent,L;Zigeuner,Richard,R;Val√	-1.24607

The objective of this study was to examine whether there is an association between individual and family eating patterns during childhood and early adolescence and the likelihood of developing a subsequent eating disorder . A total of 1664 participants took part in the study . The ED cases were referred for assessment and treatment to specialized ED units in five different European countries and were compared to a control group of healthy individuals . Participants completed the Early Eating Environmental Subscale of the Cross-Cultural Questionnaire , a retrospective measure , which has been developed as part of a European multicentre trial in order to detect dimensions associated with ED in different countries . In the control group , also the General Health Questionnaire-28 , the semi-structured clinical interview and the Eating Attitudes Test were used . Five individually Categorical Principal Components Analysis procedures were adjusted , one for each theoretically expected factor . Logistic regression analyses indicated that the domains with the strongest effects from the CatPCA scores in the total sample were : food used as individualization , and control and rules about food . On the other hand , healthy eating was negatively related to a subsequent ED . When differences between countries were assessed , results indicated that the pattern of associated ED factors did vary between countries . There was very little difference in early eating behaviour on the subtypes of ED . These findings suggest that the fragmentation of meals within the family and an excessive importance given to food by the individual and the family are linked to the later development of an ED . 	2008	2008-08-30	The British journal of nutrition;2009 Mar;101;6;909-18;	Krug,Isabel,I;Treasure,Janet,J;Anderluh,Marija,M;Bellodi,Laura,L;Cellini,Elena,E;Collier,David,D;Bernardo,Milena di,M;Granero,Roser,R;Karwautz,Andreas,A;Nacmias,Benedetta,B;Penelo,Eva,E;Ricca,Valdo,V;Sorbi,Sandro,S;Tchanturia,Kate,K;Wagner,Gudrun,G;Fern√	-0.991023

This study compared the efficacy and safety of two antiplatelet regimens -- aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole versus clopidogrel . METHODS : In this double-blind , 2-by-2 factorial trial , we randomly assigned patients to receive 25 mg of aspirin plus 200 mg of extended-release dipyridamole twice daily or to receive 75 mg of clopidogrel daily . The primary outcome was first recurrence of stroke . The secondary outcome was a composite of stroke , myocardial infarction , or death from vascular causes . Sequential statistical testing of noninferiority , followed by superiority testing , was planned . RESULTS : A total of 20,332 patients were followed for a mean of 2.5 years . Recurrent stroke occurred in 916 patients receiving ASA-ERDP and in 898 patients receiving clopidogrel . The secondary outcome occurred in 1333 patients in each group . There were more major hemorrhagic events among ASA-ERDP recipients than among clopidogrel recipients , including intracranial hemorrhage . The net risk of recurrent stroke or major hemorrhagic event was similar in the two groups . CONCLUSIONS : The trial did not meet the predefined criteria for noninferiority but showed similar rates of recurrent stroke with ASA-ERDP and with clopidogrel .

BACKGROUND : The treatment of ischaemic stroke with neuroprotective drugs has been unsuccessful , and whether these compounds can be used to reduce disability after recurrent stroke is unknown . The putative neuroprotective effects of antiplatelet compounds and the angiotensin II receptor antagonist telmisartan were investigated in the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes trial . METHODS : Patients who had had an ischaemic stroke were randomly assigned in a two by two factorial design to receive either 25 mg aspirin and 200 mg extended-release dipyridamole twice a day or 75 mg clopidogrel once a day , and either 80 mg telmisartan or placebo once per day . The predefined endpoints for this substudy were disability after a recurrent stroke , assessed with the modified Rankin scale and Barthel index at 3 months , and cognitive function , assessed with the mini-mental state examination score at 4 weeks after randomisation and at the penultimate visit . Analysis was by intention to treat . The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT00153062 . FINDINGS : 20,332 patients were randomised and followed-up for a median of 2.4 years . Recurrent strokes occurred in 916 patients randomly assigned to ASA with ER-DP and 898 patients randomly assigned to clopidogrel ; 880 patients randomly assigned to telmisartan and 934 patients given placebo had recurrent strokes . mRS scores were not statistically different in patients with recurrent stroke who were treated with ASA and ER-DP versus clopidogrel , or with telmisartan versus placebo . There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with recurrent stroke with a good outcome , as measured with the Barthel index , across all treatment groups . Additionally , there was no significant difference in the median MMSE scores , the percentage of patients with an MMSE score of 24 points or less , the percentage of patients with a drop in MMSE score of 3 points or more between 1 month and the penultimate visit , and the number of patients with dementia among the treatment groups . There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients with cognitive impairment or dementia among the treatment groups . INTERPRETATION : Disability due to recurrent stroke and cognitive decline in patients with ischaemic stroke were not different between the two antiplatelet regimens and were not affected by the preventive use of telmisartan . 	2008	2008-09-02	Lancet neurology;2008 Oct;7;10;875-84;	Diener,Hans-Christoph,HC;Sacco,Ralph L,RL;Yusuf,Salim,S;Cotton,Daniel,D;Ounpuu,Stephanie,S;Lawton,William A,WA;Palesch,Yuko,Y;Martin,Rene√© H,RH;Albers,Gregory W,GW;Bath,Philip,P;Bornstein,Natan,N;Chan,Bernard P L,BP;Chen,Sien-Tsong,ST;Cunha,Luis,L;Dahl√	-1.42736

BACKGROUND : The gene for preferentially expressed antigen of melanoma has been shown to be over-expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia , but its actual incidence and clinical impact are still unknown . DESIGN AND METHODS : We studied PRAME expression at diagnosis using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 125 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia enrolled in the Spanish PETHEMA-96 and PETHEMA-99 clinical trials . In addition , PRAME expression was evaluated as a marker of disease activity in 225 follow-up samples from 67 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia . RESULTS : At diagnosis , PRAME expression in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia was significantly higher than in patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia and in healthy controls . Furthermore , patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia with high PRAME expression had a favorable outcome . Thus , the 5-year relapse-free survival was better in patients with &gt; 100-fold PRAME expression , and this cut-off established two sub-groups with different relapse-free survival rates among patients with a white cell count &lt; 10 / L . This effect was similar in patients with a white cell count &gt; 10 / L , although differences were not statistically significant . In multivariate analysis , white cell count &gt; 10 / L , bone marrow blasts &gt; 90 % , and PRAME expression &lt; 100-fold were associated with short relapse-free survival . Samples at remission showed PRAME levels similar to those in normal controls while samples at relapse over-expressed PRAME again . Furthermore , 12 / 13 samples collected within the 6-month period preceding relapse showed a &gt; 10-fold increase in PRAME expression levels . CONCLUSIONS : Low PRAME expression defines a subgroup of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia with a short relapse-free survival .

OBJECTIVES : The utility of many molecules as tumor markers in melanoma has been investigated with different results . The aims of this study was to compare the value of tyrosinase mRNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood and of serum S-100 protein in patients with melanoma at different stages of disease . METHODS : We have studied 90 peripheral blood samples corresponding to 90 patients that had been diagnosed with melanoma . The clinical staging at the time of blood sampling was performed according to the American Join Committee on Cancer guidelines . S-100 protein in serum was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the presence of tyrosinase mRNA was assessed by RT-PCR . RESULTS : Median progression-free survival was 281 days for tyrosinase positive patients and it has not been reached for tyrosinase negative patients . Median progression free survival was 213 days for patients with elevated serum S-100 and it has not been reached for patients with normal level of serum S-100 . Median overall survival was 396 days for tyrosinase positive patients and it has not been reached for negative patients . Median OS was 282 days for patients with elevated serum S-100 and it has not been reached for patients with normal level of serum S-100 . In a multivariate analysis , both markers have significant prognostic value for time to progression and for survival . CONCLUSIONS : RT-PCR for tyrosinase mRNA and S-100 are significant prognostic factors for progression-free survival and OS in melanoma .

ERROR 18371263: 18928733	Prospective study on the practice of central nervous system prophylaxis and treatment in non-Hodgkin &apos; s lymphoma in Spain . 	BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Central nervous system involvement in patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin &apos; s lymphoma or other lymphoproliferative disorders is an infrequent complication with a poor prognosis . The prophylaxis and treatment of CNS involvement in these patients are not homogenous . The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to report the current practice of CNS prophylaxis and treatment in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders in Spain . METHODS : Prospective study conducted from June 2005 to June 2006 . Adult patients diagnosed with NHL or other lymphoproliferative disorders who received CNS prophylaxis or treatment were consecutively included through online registration . RESULTS : 228 patients from 33 hospitals were included . The mean age was 52 yr and 144 were males . CNS therapy was given to 41 cases and consisted of triple intrathecal therapy in 22 , liposomal depot cytarabine in 18 and methotrexate in one . In addition , 4 patients received cranial radiotherapy . CNS prophylaxis consisted of TIT , IT methotrexate , IT liposomal depot cytarabine and IT cytarabine , whereas cranial or craniospinal radiotherapy was administered to 2 patients . The main reasons for CNS prophylaxis cited by the investigators included extranodal involvement , raised serum lactate dehydrogenase level , IPI score &gt; 2 , bulky mass , extranodal involvement in more than one organ , age over 60 yr and human immunodeficiency virus infection . CONCLUSIONS : The results of this study point out the generalized use of TIT therapy both for CNS prophylaxis and therapy in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders in Spain . The introduction of the new formulations of drugs , especially liposomal depot cytarabine for CNS involvement , and the scarce use of radiotherapy are also of note . Similar to other studies , the absence of homogeneous criteria for CNS prophylaxis is of note . 	2008	2008-10-22	Medicina cl√≠nica;2008 Oct 11;131;12;441-6;	Sancho,Juan-Manuel,JM;Morgades,Mireia,M;Alonso,Natalia,N;Deben,Guillermo,G;Fern√°ndez de Sevilla,Alberto,A;V√°zquez,Lourdes,L;Nicol√°s,Concepci√≥n,C;Garc√≠a Vela,Jos√©-Antonio,JA;Arranz,Reyes,R;Abella,Eugenia,E;Canales,Miguel-Angel,MA;Miralles,Pilar,P;S√	-1.26333
ERROR 18371301: 18928772	. 	INTRODUCTION : The use of a new therapeutic alternative involving cytoreductive surgery with perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy in the treatment of patients suffering from peritoneal carcinomatosis represents a new challenge for the multidisciplinary teams caring for these patients . Their post-operative progress and care needs , apart from differing from those of conventional patients , have not yet been completely defined or protocolised . In this presentation we explain the special characteristics of these patients compared to the usual surgical patients , the possible physiopathological mechanisms which may give rise to the different types of complications , the circumstances when a temporary abdominal closure is necessary , the ideal conditions required for an optimal technique , and finally our experience with the open vacuum abdomen technique in the treatment of the complications that appear in patients treated by this new triple combined therapy . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Based on our personal experience in the treatment of 110 cytoreductions carried out between February 1997 and February 2007 on 71 patients suffering from peritoneal carcinomatosis of various origins . Of the 71 patients , 50 suffered some kind of complication during their postoperative evolution , 28 of them requiring re-operation for a Grade III-IV postoperative complication . The abdominal situation made a temporary closure desirable in 17 patients , having applied an open vacuum abdomen technique on every occasion . We study this group of patients according their original type of tumour and stage of the disease at the cytoreductive procedure , peritonectomies and visceral resections required , type of postoperative complications , treatment applied and evolution . RESULTS : A total of 52 open vacuum abdomen procedures were required before the abdominal complication could be completely kept under control in these 17 patients . Only 2 postoperative intestinal fistulas were directly related to this technique , and a primary closure of the whole abdominal wall was possible in 11 of these patients . All but one of them left the hospital alive and well . CONCLUSIONS : As a consequence of this experience , in our opinion , the open vacuum abdomen is the ideal election technique to be employed in any temporary closure of the abdominal cavity for whatever reason it is required , including the worst possible surgical scenario , as we have demonstrated in the treatment of surgical complications after cytoreductive procedures and intraperitoneal chemohyperthermia . 	2008	2008-10-22	Cirug√≠a espa√±ola;2008 Oct;84;4;215-20;	G√≥mez Portilla,Alberto,A;Cendoya,Ignacio,I;Olabarria,Ignacio,I;Echevarr√≠a,Jes√∫s,J;Mart√≠nez de Lecea,Concepci√≥n,C;Romero,Erika,E;Guede,Nerea,N;Moraza,Nuria,N;Fern√°ndez,Elena,E;Kvadatze,Mijail,M;Larrabide,I√±aki,I;Valdovinos,Mercedes,M;Ruiz de Alegr√	-1.80415
ERROR 18372588: 18930104	Effect of antipsychotic drugs on brain morphometry . A randomized controlled one-year follow-up study of haloperidol , risperidone and olanzapine . 	BACKGROUND : The effect of antipsychotic drugs on brain morphology is under debate . Here we investigate the effects of risperidone , olanzapine and low doses of haloperidol on cortical and subcortical morphometry in first episode drug na√Øve patients with non-affective psychosis . METHODS : Morphological variables were measured in three treatment groups and in healthy subjects at baseline and after one year . The relationship between brain morphometric changes and changes in clinical scores was also assessed . RESULTS : At one year , the three antipsychotics had had an equal effect on the gray matter cortical structure , overall and lobes . A significant time-by-group interaction was found in lateral ventricle volume . Post-hoc comparisons revealed a significant increase in lateral ventricles in patients treated with risperidone . Patients exposed to atypicals exhibited a decrease in caudate nucleus volume . In general , brain changes did not account in any significant manner for clinical changes over time in any treatment group . CONCLUSIONS : We conclude that low doses of haloperidol , risperidone and olanzapine seem to have an equal effect on the gray matter cortical structure after 1 year of treatment . In contrast to typical antipsychotics , atypicals have differential effects on lateral ventricle and caudate nucleus volumes . 	2008	2008-10-22	Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology &amp; biological psychiatry;2008 Dec 12;32;8;1936-43;	Crespo-Facorro,Benedicto,B;Roiz-Santi√°√±ez,Roberto,R;P√©rez-Iglesias,Roc√≠o,R;Pelayo-Ter√°n,Jos√© M,JM;Rodr√≠guez-S√°nchez,Jos√© M,JM;Tordesillas-Guti√©rrez,Diana,D;Ram√≠rez,MariLuz,M;Mart√≠nez,Obdulia,O;Guti√©rrez,Agustin,A;de Lucas,Enrique Marco,EM;V√	-1.40484
ERROR 18383402: 18941248	Analysis of CD97 expression and manipulation : antibody treatment but not gene targeting curtails granulocyte migration . 	The heptahelical receptor CD97 is a defining member of the EGF-TM7 family of adhesion class receptors . In both humans and mice , CD97 isoforms are expressed with variable numbers of tandemly arranged N-terminal epidermal growth factor-like domains that facilitate interactions with distinct cellular ligands . Results from treatment of mice with mAbs in various disease models have suggested a role for CD97 in leukocyte trafficking . Here , we aimed to thoroughly characterize the expression profile of CD97 , and delineate its biological function . To this end , we applied a novel polyclonal Ab , which is the first antiserum suitable for immunohistochemistry , and combined this analysis with the study of Cd97-lacZ knock-in mice . We show that similar to the situation in humans , hematopoietic , epithelial , endothelial , muscle , and fat cells expressed CD97 . Despite this broad expression pattern , the Cd97 mouse that we created had no overt phenotype , except for a mild granulocytosis . Furthermore , granulocyte accumulation at sites of inflammation was normal in the absence of CD97 . Interestingly , application of CD97 mAbs blocked granulocyte trafficking after thioglycollate-induced peritonitis in wild-type but not in knock-out mice . Hence , we conclude that CD97 mAbs actively induce an inhibitory effect that disturbs normal granulocyte trafficking , which is not perturbed by the absence of the molecule . 	2008	2008-10-23	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);2008 Nov 1;181;9;6574-83;	Veninga,Henrike,H;Becker,Susann,S;Hoek,Robert M,RM;Wobus,Manja,M;Wandel,Elke,E;van der Kaa,Jos,J;van der Valk,Martin,M;de Vos,Alex F,AF;Haase,Hannelore,H;Owens,Bronwyn,B;van der Poll,Tom,T;van Lier,Ren√© A W,RA;Verbeek,J Sjef,JS;Aust,Gabriela,G;Hamann,J√	-0.478733

Microsatellite instability occurs in 10 % to 20 % of colorectal cancers and has been attributed to both MLH1 promoter hypermethylation and germline mutation in the mismatch repair genes . We present results from a large population- and clinic-based study of MLH1 methylation , immunohistochemistry , and MMR germline mutations that enabled us to estimate the prevalence of MMR germline mutations and MLH1 methylation among MSI-H cases and help us understand if all MSI-H CRC is explained by these mechanisms and estimate the associations between MLH1 methylation and sex , age , and tumor location within the colon . MLH1 methylation was measured in 1,061 population-based and 172 clinic-based cases of CRC . Overall , we observed MLH1 methylation in 60 % of population-based MSI-H cases and in 13 % of clinic-based MSI-H cases . Within the population-based cases with MMR mutation screening and conclusive immunohistochemistry results , we identified a molecular event in MMR in 91 % of MSI-H cases : 54 % had MLH1 methylation , 14 % had a germline mutation in a MMR gene , and 23 % had immunohistochemistry evidence for loss of a MMR protein . We observed a striking age difference , with the prevalence of a MMR germline mutation more than 4-fold lower and the prevalence of MLH1 methylation more than 4-fold higher in cases diagnosed after the age of 50 years than in cases diagnosed before that age . We also determined that female sex is an independent predictor of MLH1 methylation within the MSI-H subgroup . These results reinforce the importance of distinguishing between the underlying causes of MSI in studies of etiology and prognosis . 	2008	2008-11-08	Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers &amp; prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology;2008 Nov;17;11;3208-15;	Poynter,Jenny N,JN;Siegmund,Kimberly D,KD;Weisenberger,Daniel J,DJ;Long,Tiffany I,TI;Thibodeau,Stephen N,SN;Lindor,Noralane,N;Young,Joanne,J;Jenkins,Mark A,MA;Hopper,John L,JL;Baron,John A,JA;Buchanan,Dan,D;Casey,Graham,G;Levine,A Joan,AJ;Le Marchand,Lo√	-0.81332

To elucidate the &quot; atypicality &quot; of ziprasidone , its striatal and extrastriatal D2 / D3-receptor binding was characterized in patients with schizophrenia under steady-state conditions . These data were compared with striatal receptor occupancy values after single-dose ziprasidone ingestion in healthy controls . fallypride positron emission tomography recordings were obtained in 15 patients under steady-state ziprasidone treatment at varying time points after the last dose . Binding potentials were calculated for striatal and extrastriatal regions . D2 / D3-receptor occupancies were expressed relative to binding potentials in 8 unmedicated patients . In a parallel raclopride-PET study , striatal D2 / D3-receptor occupancy was measured in healthy subjects after single oral doses of 40 mg ziprasidone or 7.5 mg haloperidol . Ziprasidone plasma concentrations correlated significantly with D2 / D3-receptor occupancies in all volumes of interests . Occupancy in extrastriatal regions was approximately 10 % higher than in striatal regions . Half maximal effective concentration values were consistently higher in striatal than in extrastriatal regions , irrespective of the time between last dosing and scan . Single ziprasidone doses resulted in higher occupancies exceeding the 95 % prediction limits of the occupancy versus plasma concentrations for chronic dosing . Ziprasidone shares moderate preferential extrastriatal D2 / D3-receptor binding with some other atypicals . D2 / D3-receptor occupancy is rapidly attuning to the daily course of ziprasidone plasma levels , suggesting relatively high intraday variations of D2 / D3-receptor binding . The discrepancies between single-dose and steady-state results are important for the future design of dose-finding PET occupancy studies of novel antipsychotics .

A &quot; divergent pathway &quot; model for the development of cutaneous melanoma has been proposed . The model hypothesizes that melanomas occurring in people with a low tendency to develop nevi will , on average , arise more commonly on habitually sun-exposed body sites such as the head and neck . In contrast , people with an inherent propensity to develop nevi will tend to develop melanomas most often on body sites with large melanocyte populations , such as on the back . We conducted a collaborative analysis to test this hypothesis using the original data from 10 case-control studies of melanoma in women , with assessment of the potential confounding effects of socioeconomic , pigmentary and sun exposure-related factors . Higher nevus count on the arm was associated specifically with an increased risk of melanoma of the trunk and limbs , but not of the head and neck . The pooled odds ratios for the highest quartile of nonzero nevus count versus none were 4.6 for melanoma of the trunk , 2.0 for the head and neck , 4.2 for the upper limbs and 3.4 for the lower limbs . Aggregate data from these studies suggest that high nevus counts are strongly associated with melanoma of the trunk but less so if at all of the head and neck .

Pegylated interferon alfa-2a may induce sustained virological response in 20 % of hepatitis B e antigen -negative chronic hepatitis B patients . In addition , loss of hepatitis B surface antigen is achieved with a 10 % yearly rate after treatment cessation in sustained responders . The aim of this study was to assess on-treatment serum HBsAg kinetics to predict SVR in HBeAg-negative patients treated with PEG-IFN . Forty-eight consecutive patients were treated with PEG-IFN for 48 weeks . Serum hepatitis B virus DNA and HBsAg were assessed at baseline , during treatment , and during follow-up . SVR was defined as undetectable serum HBV DNA 24 weeks after treatment cessation . Twenty-five percent of patients achieved SVR . They were not different from those who failed treatment regarding age , sex , ethnicity , HBV genotype , baseline serum HBV DNA and HBsAg levels , or liver histology . During treatment , serum HBsAg levels decreased only in patients who developed SVR , with mean decreases of 0.8 +/- 0.5 , 1.5 +/- 0.6 , and 2.1 +/- 1.2 log IU / mL at weeks 12 , 24 , and 48 , respectively . A decrease of 0.5 and 1 log IU / mL in serum HBsAg levels at weeks 12 and 24 of therapy , respectively , had high predictive values of SVR . HBsAg loss was observed in three patients , all with SVR .

ERROR 18574503: 19147582	High frequency of TP53 mutation in BRCA1 and sporadic basal-like carcinomas but not in BRCA1 luminal breast tumors . 	Breast tumors with a germ-line mutation of BRCA1 and basal-like carcinoma are associated with a high rate of TP53 mutation . Because BRCA1 tumors frequently display a basal-like phenotype , this study was designed to determine whether TP53 mutations are correlated with the hereditary BRCA1 mutated status or the particular phenotype of these tumors . The TP53 gene status was first investigated in a series of 35 BRCA1 BLCs using immunohistochemistry , direct sequencing of the coding sequence , and functional analysis of separated alleles in yeast , and compared with the TP53 status in a series of 38 sporadic BLCs . Using this sensitive approach , TP53 was found to be frequently mutated in both BRCA1 and sporadic BLCs . However , the spectrum of mutation was different , particularly with a higher rate of complex mutations , such as insertion / deletion , in BRCA1 BLCs than in the sporadic group . Secondly , the incidence of TP53 mutations was analyzed in 19 BRCA1 luminal tumors using the same strategy . Interestingly , only 10 of these 19 tumors were mutated , a frequency similar to that found in grade-matched sporadic luminal tumors . In conclusion , TP53 mutation is highly recurrent in BLCs independently of BRCA1 status , but not a common feature of BRCA1 luminal tumors . 	2009	2009-01-17	Cancer research;2009 Jan 15;69;2;663-71;	Mani√©,Elodie,E;Vincent-Salomon,Anne,A;Lehmann-Che,Jacqueline,J;Pierron,Gaelle,G;Turpin,Elisabeth,E;Warcoin,Mathilde,M;Gruel,Nad√®ge,N;Lebigot,Ingrid,I;Sastre-Garau,Xavier,X;Lidereau,Rosette,R;Remenieras,Audrey,A;Feunteun,Jean,J;Delattre,Olivier,O;de Th√	-1.05854
ERROR 18590216: 19164206	Epigenetic regulation of microRNAs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia . 	PURPOSE : To identify microRNAs epigenetically regulated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia . METHODS : We first examined ALL-derived cell lines for the presence of abnormal levels of two different histone modifications in the 5 &apos; UTR regions around CpG islands of 78 miRNAs by chromatin immunoprecipitation -on-ChIP analysis . Methylation status and expression of miRNAs showing a pattern of histone modifications linked to a closed chromatin structure were analyzed in a panel of six ALL cell lines and in 353 ALL patients . RESULTS : CpG islands around 13 miRNAs disclosed high levels of K9H3me2 and/or low levels of K4H3me3 , a pattern of histone modifications underlying a closed chromatin structure associated with repressive gene expression . Complete consistency in the correlation between both histone marks , the presence of DNA methylation around these miRNAs , and their expression patterns was confirmed in the six ALL cell lines . Treatment with 5-Aza-2 &apos; -deoxycytidine upregulated the expression levels of these genes , suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms deregulate the expression of these miRNAs . A total of 65 % of the ALL samples had at least one miRNA methylated . Estimated disease-free survival and overall survival at 14 years were 78 % and 71 % for nonmethylated patients and 24 % and 28 % for methylated patients . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that methylation profile was an independent prognostic factor for predicting DFS and OS . CONCLUSION : Aberrant miRNA methylation is a common phenomenon in ALL that affects the clinical outcome of these patients . 	2009	2009-01-24	Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology;2009 Mar 10;27;8;1316-22;	Roman-Gomez,Jose,J;Agirre,Xabier,X;Jim√©nez-Velasco,Antonio,A;Arqueros,Victor,V;Vilas-Zornoza,Amaia,A;Rodriguez-Otero,Paula,P;Martin-Subero,I√±aki,I;Garate,Leire,L;Cordeu,Lucia,L;San Jos√©-Eneriz,Edurne,E;Martin,Vanesa,V;Castillejo,Juan Antonio,JA;Bandr√	-1.08683

BACKGROUND : Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy plus the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody bevacizumab is standard first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer . We studied the effect of adding the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody cetuximab to a combination of capecitabine , oxaliplatin , and bevacizumab for metastatic colorectal cancer . METHODS : We randomly assigned 755 patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer to capecitabine , oxaliplatin , and bevacizumab or the same regimen plus weekly cetuximab . The primary end point was progression-free survival . The mutation status of the KRAS gene was evaluated as a predictor of outcome . RESULTS : The median progression-free survival was 10.7 months in the CB group and 9.4 in the CBC group . Quality-of-life scores were lower in the CBC group . The overall survival and response rates did not differ significantly in the two groups . Treated patients in the CBC group had more grade 3 or 4 adverse events , which were attributed to cetuximab-related adverse cutaneous effects . Patients treated with cetuximab who had tumors bearing a mutated KRAS gene had significantly decreased progression-free survival as compared with cetuximab-treated patients with wild-type-KRAS tumors or patients with mutated-KRAS tumors in the CB group . CONCLUSIONS : The addition of cetuximab to capecitabine , oxaliplatin , and bevacizumab resulted in significantly shorter progression-free survival and inferior quality of life . Mutation status of the KRAS gene was a predictor of outcome in the cetuximab group . 	2009	2009-02-07	The New England journal of medicine;2009 Feb 5;360;6;563-72;	Tol,Jolien,J;Koopman,Miriam,M;Cats,Annemieke,A;Rodenburg,Cees J,CJ;Creemers,Geert J M,GJ;Schrama,Jolanda G,JG;Erdkamp,Frans L G,FL;Vos,Allert H,AH;van Groeningen,Cees J,CJ;Sinnige,Harm A M,HA;Richel,Dirk J,DJ;Voest,Emile E,EE;Dijkstra,Jeroen R,JR;Vink-B√	-1.25669
ERROR 18653891: 19232124	Reduced IgG anti-small nuclear ribonucleoprotein autoantibody production in systemic lupus erythematosus patients with positive IgM anti-cytomegalovirus antibodies . 	INTRODUCTION : Systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by production of autoantibodies to RNA or DNA-protein complexes such as small nuclear ribonucleoproteins . A role of Epstein-Barr virus in the pathogenesis has been suggested . Similar to Epstein-Barr virus , cytomegalovirus infects the majority of individuals at a young age and establishes latency with a potential for reactivation . Homology of CMV glycoprotein B with the U1snRNP-70 kDa protein has been described ; however , the role of CMV infection in production of anti-snRNPs is controversial . We investigated the association of CMV serology and autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus . METHODS : Sixty-one Mexican patients with systemic lupus erythematosus were tested for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus serology and autoantibodies by immunoprecipitation and ELISA . RESULTS : IgG anti-CMV and IgM anti-CMV were positive in 95 % and 33 % , respectively , and two cases were negative for both . Clinical manifestation and autoantibodies in the IgM anti-CMV+ group versus the IgM anti-CMVIgG+ group were compared . Most of the IgM anti-CMV+ cases were IgG anti-CMV+ , consistent with reactivation or reinfection . IgM anti-CMV was unrelated to rheumatoid factor or IgM class autoantibodies and none was positive for IgM anti-Epstein-Barr virus-viral capsid antigen , indicating that this is not simply due to false positive results caused by rheumatoid factor or nonspecific binding by certain IgM . The IgM anti-CMV+ group has significantly lower levels of IgG anti-U1RNP / Sm and IgG anti-U1-70 k . This finding was also confirmed by immunoprecipitation . Among the IgM anti-CMV subset , anti-Su was associated with anti-U1RNP and anti-Ro . High levels of IgG anti-CMV were associated with production of lupus-related autoantibodies to RNA or DNA-protein complex . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings suggest a potential role of CMV in regulation of autoantibodies to snRNPs and may provide a unique insight to understand the pathogenesis . 	2009	2009-02-24	Arthritis research &amp; therapy;2009;11;1;R27;	Palafox S√°nchez,Claudia Azucena,CA;Satoh,Minoru,M;Chan,Edward Kl,EK;Carcamo,Wendy C,WC;Mu√±oz Valle,Jos√© Francisco,JF;Orozco Barocio,Gerardo,G;Oregon Romero,Edith,E;Navarro Hern√°ndez,Rosa Elena,RE;Salazar P√°ramo,Mario,M;Cabral Casta√±eda,Antonio,A;V√	-0.255086
ERROR 18665019: 19243990	Natural human infections with Vaccinia virus during bovine vaccinia outbreaks . 	BACKGROUND : Bovine vaccinia is an exanthematic disease caused by Vaccinia virus . This zoonosis has been associated with several cases of bovine infection , particularly in milk herds . Farmers , milkers and their close contacts developed lesions on the hands , forearms , legs and face accompanied by fever , headache , malaise , myalgia and axillary , inguinal and cervical lymphadenopathy . VACV infections have a significant public health impact due to their occupational character , high frequency of transmission and the improper medical treatment often applied . OBJECTIVES : To study natural human infection by VACV and to analyze clinical and epidemiological aspects , emphasizing the patients &apos; immunological status . STUDY DESIGN : Ninety-eight individuals from rural properties with bovine vaccinia outbreaks who were at risk due to contact were submitted to epidemiological and clinical studies . From these individuals , 54 sera were analyzed by serological and molecular procedures . This study was conducted in Rio de Janeiro State from September 2002 to October 2006 . RESULTS : The clinical frequency of infection was 52.0 % , with 57.4 % ELISA and 43.0 % PRNT-positive reactions . DNAemia was detected in 18.5 % of the analyzed sera , and 50 % of smallpox-vaccinated individuals developed symptoms . CONCLUSIONS : This study confirms the high clinical frequency of human VACV infection , even among vaccinated individuals . The infection was related to detection of IgG- or IgM-specific antibodies that correlates in most of the cases with positive PRNT . The DNAemia suggests viremia during VACV natural infections . Our data indicate that patients vaccinated against smallpox may no longer be protected . 	2009	2009-02-27	Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology;2009 Apr;44;4;308-13;	Silva-Fernandes,Andr√© Tavares,AT;Travassos,Carlos Eurico Pires Ferreira,CE;Ferreira,Jaqueline Maria Siqueira,JM;Abrah√£o,J√¥natas Santos,JS;Rocha,Eliseu Soares de Oliveira,ES;Viana-Ferreira,Fl√°via,F;dos Santos,Jo√£o Rodrigues,JR;Bonjardim,Cl√°udio Ant√	-1.26878

Profound ecological changes are occurring on coral reefs throughout the tropics , with marked coral cover losses and concomitant algal increases , particularly in the Caribbean region . Historical declines in the abundance of large Caribbean reef fishes likely reflect centuries of overexploitation . However , effects of drastic recent degradation of reef habitats on reef fish assemblages have yet to be established . By using meta-analysis , we analyzed time series of reef fish density obtained from 48 studies that include 318 reefs across the Caribbean and span the time period 1955-2007 . Our analyses show that overall reef fish density has been declining significantly for more than a decade , at rates that are consistent across all subregions of the Caribbean basin and in three of six trophic groups . Changes in fish density over the past half-century are modest relative to concurrent changes in benthic cover on Caribbean reefs . However , the recent significant decline in overall fish abundance and its consistency across several trophic groups and among both fished and nonfished species indicate that Caribbean fishes have begun to respond negatively to habitat degradation . 	2009	2009-03-24	Current biology : CB;2009 Apr 14;19;7;590-5;	Paddack,Michelle J,MJ;Reynolds,John D,JD;Aguilar,Consuelo,C;Appeldoorn,Richard S,RS;Beets,Jim,J;Burkett,Edward W,EW;Chittaro,Paul M,PM;Clarke,Kristen,K;Esteves,Rene,R;Fonseca,Ana C,AC;Forrester,Graham E,GE;Friedlander,Alan M,AM;Garc√≠a-Sais,Jorge,J;Gonz√	-1.25646

BACKGROUND : The relevance of persistent cognitive deficits to the pathogenesis and prognosis of bipolar disorders is understudied , and its translation into clinical practice has been limited by the absence of brief methods assessing cognitive status in Psychiatry . This investigation assessed the psychometric properties of the Spanish version of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry for the detection of cognitive impairment in BD . METHODS : After short training , psychiatrists at 40 outpatient clinics administered the SCIP three times over two weeks to a total of 76 consecutive type I BD admissions . Experienced psychologists also administered a comprehensive battery of standard neuropsychological instruments to clinical sample and 45 healthy control subjects . RESULTS : Feasibility was supported by a brief administration time and minimal scoring errors . The reliability of the SCIP was confirmed by good equivalence of forms , acceptable stability and adequate internal consistency . Construct validity was granted by extraction of a single factor , acceptable correlations with conventional neuropsychological instruments , and a clear differentiation between bipolar I and normal samples . Efficiency was also provided by the adequate sensitivity and specificity . LIMITATIONS : The sample size is not very large . The SCIP and the neurocognitive battery do not cover all potentially relevant cognitive domains . Also , sensitivity to change remains unexplored . CONCLUSION : With minimal training , physicians obtained a reliable and valid estimate of cognitive impairment in approximately 15 minutes from an application of the SCIP to type I BD patients . 	2009	2009-04-03	Health and quality of life outcomes;2009;7;;28;	Guilera,Georgina,G;Pino,Oscar,O;G√≥mez-Benito,Juana,J;Rojo,J Emilio,JE;Vieta,Eduard,E;Tabar√©s-Seisdedos,Rafael,R;Segarra,Nuria,N;Mart√≠nez-Ar√°n,Anabel,A;Franco,Manuel,M;Cuesta,Manuel J,MJ;Crespo-Facorro,Benedicto,B;Bernardo,Miguel,M;Purdon,Scot E,SE;D√	-1.01834

A subgroup of breast cancer patients with particularly poor clinical outcomes expresses a heterogeneous collection of HER2 carboxy-terminal fragments . However , since the CTFs lack the extracellular domain that drives dimerization and subsequent activation of full-length HER2 , they are in principle expected to be inactive . Here we show that at low expression levels one of these fragments , 611-CTF , activated multiple signaling pathways because of its unanticipated ability to constitutively homodimerize . A transcriptomic analysis revealed that 611-CTF specifically controlled the expression of genes that we found to be correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer . Among the 611-CTF-regulated genes were several that have previously been linked to metastasis , including those for MET , EPHA2 , matrix metalloproteinase 1 , interleukin 11 , angiopoietin-like 4 , and different integrins . It is thought that transgenic mice overexpressing HER2 in the mammary glands develop tumors only after acquisition of activating mutations in the transgene . In contrast , we show that expression of 611-CTF led to development of aggressive and invasive mammary tumors without the need for mutations .

ERROR 18957641: 19560901	Defining and predicting functional outcome in schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum disorders . 	BACKGROUND : To assess criteria and to identify predictive factors for functional outcome . The criteria should cover all domains proposed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group . METHOD : PANSS ratings were used to evaluate the symptomatic treatment outcome of 262 inpatients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders within a naturalistic multicenter trial . Functional remission was defined as a GAF score &gt; 61 , SOFAS score &gt; 61 and a SF-36 mental health subscore &gt; 40 . Multivariate logistic regression and CART analyses were used to determine valid clinical and sociodemographic predictors . RESULTS : In total , 52 patients fulfilled the criteria for functional remission , 125 patients achieved symptomatic resolution and when criteria for functional remission and symptomatic resolution were combined 33 patients achieved complete remission . Younger age , employment , a shorter duration of illness , a shorter length of current episode , less suicidality , and a lower PANSS negative and global subscore at admission were predictive of functional remission . The regression model showed a predictive value of more than 80 % . CONCLUSIONS : A significant association was found between functional remission and symptomatic resolution , indicating reasonable validity of the proposed definition for functional outcome . The revealed predictors for functional treatment outcome emphasize the need for psychosocial and vocational rehabilitation in schizophrenic patients . 	2009	2009-06-30	Schizophrenia research;2009 Sep;113;2-3;210-7;	Schennach-Wolff,Rebecca,R;J√§ger,Markus,M;Seem√ºller,Florian,F;Obermeier,Michael,M;Messer,Thomas,T;Laux,Gerd,G;Pfeiffer,Herbert,H;Naber,Dieter,D;Schmidt,Lutz G,LG;Gaebel,Wolfgang,W;Huff,Wolfgang,W;Heuser,Isabella,I;Maier,Wolfgang,W;Lemke,Matthias R,MR;R√	-0.850551

Resistance to Imatinib Mesylate is a major problem in Chronic Myelogenous Leukaemia management . Most of the studies about resistance have focused on point mutations on BCR / ABL . However , other types of resistance that do not imply mutations in BCR / ABL have been also described . In the present report we aim to study the role of several MAPK in IM resistance not associate to BCR / ABL mutations . Therefore we used an experimental system of resistant cell lines generated by co-culturing with IM as well as primary material from resistant and responder patient without BCR / ABL mutations . Here we demonstrate that Erk5 and p38MAPK signaling pathways are not implicated in the acquired resistance phenotype . However , Erk2 , but not Erk1 , is critical for the acquired resistance to IM . In fact , Bcr / Abl activates preferentially Erk2 in transient transfection in a dose dependent fashion through the c-Abl part of the chimeric protein . Finally , we present evidences demonstrating how constitutive activation of Erk2 is a de novo mechanism of resistance to IM . In summary our data support the use of therapeutic approaches based on Erk2 inhibition , which could be added to the therapeutic armamentarium to fight CML , especially when IM resistance develops secondary to Erk2 activation . 	2009	2009-07-02	PloS one;2009;4;7;e6124;	Aceves-Luquero,Clara I,CI;Agarwal,Anupriya,A;Callejas-Valera,Juan L,JL;Arias-Gonz√°lez,Laura,L;Espar√≠s-Ogando,Azucena,A;del Peso Ovalle,Luis,L;Bell√≥n-Echeverria,Itxaso,I;de la Cruz-Morcillo,Miguel A,MA;Gal√°n Moya,Eva M,EM;Moreno Gimeno,Inmaculada,I;G√	-0.762644

BACKGROUND &amp; # 38 ; AIMS : Patients with cirrhosis undergoing selective intestinal decontamination with norfloxacin show a reduction in serum cytokine levels , probably because of a combined effect of norfloxacin on bowel flora and neutrophils . METHODS : Thirty-one patients with cirrhosis receiving norfloxacin were included . Blood samples were collected at 0.5-4 hours and at 22-24 hours after dose . Fifty-nine ascitic fluid samples were obtained . Single doses of norfloxacin and trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole were administered to 13 and 5 patients , respectively , and samples were collected at 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 4 , and 24 hours . Norfloxacin , trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole , cytokines , nitric oxide , expression levels of nuclear factor -kappaB and inhibitor of NF-kappaB , neutrophil oxidative burst , and rate of apoptotic events were determined . RESULTS : All samples were bacterial DNA negative and had no significant levels of lipopolysaccharide . Serum and ascitic levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interferon-gamma , interleukin-12 , and nitric oxide were significantly lower in peak than in trough samples . A correlation was present between serum norfloxacins concentrations and tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interferon-gamma , interleukin-12 , and nitric oxide . Serum norfloxacin &apos; s highest concentrations were achieved at 1-2 hours and concurred in time with the lower levels of cytokines and nitric oxide . Intracellular norfloxacin &apos; s highest levels were observed at 2 hours and concurred with a lower NF-kappaB expression , a reduced anion superoxide generation , and apoptotic rate in response to phorbol myristate acetate .

Dimerization is recognized as a crucial step in the activation of many plasma membrane receptors . However , a growing number of receptors pre-exist as dimers in the absence of ligand , indicating that , although necessary , dimerization is not always sufficient for signaling . The p75 neurotrophin receptor forms disulfide-linked dimers at the cell surface independently of ligand binding through Cys257 in its transmembrane domain . Here , we show that crosslinking of p75 dimers by cysteine-scanning mutagenesis results in constitutive , ligand-independent activity in several pathways that are normally engaged upon neurotrophin stimulation of native receptors . The activity profiles of different disulfide-crosslinked p75 mutants were similar but not identical , suggesting that different configurations of p75 dimers might be endowed with different functions . Interestingly , crosslinked p75 mutants did not mimic the effects of the myelin inhibitors Nogo or MAG , suggesting the existence of ligand-specific activation mechanisms .

ERROR 19147090: 19770222	Zebu cattle are an exclusive legacy of the South Asia neolithic . 	Animal domestication was a major step forward in human prehistory , contributing to the emergence of more complex societies . At the time of the Neolithic transition , zebu cattle were probably the most abundant and important domestic livestock species in Southern Asia . Although archaeological evidence points toward the domestication of zebu cattle within the Indian subcontinent , the exact geographic origins and phylogenetic history of zebu cattle remains uncertain . Here , we report evidence from 844 zebu mitochondrial DNA sequences surveyed from 19 Asiatic countries comprising 8 regional groups , which identify 2 distinct mitochondrial haplogroups , termed I1 and I2 . The marked increase in nucleotide diversity for both the I1 and I2 haplogroups within the northern part of the Indian subcontinent is consistent with an origin for all domestic zebu in this area . For haplogroup I1 , genetic diversity was highest within the Indus Valley among the three hypothesized domestication centers . These data support the Indus Valley as the most likely center of origin for the I1 haplogroup and a primary center of zebu domestication . However , for the I2 haplogroup , a complex pattern of diversity is detected , preventing the unambiguous pinpointing of the exact place of origin for this zebu maternal lineage .

ERROR 19153343: 19776698	2009 evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnosing a first episode of lower extremities deep vein thrombosis in ambulatory outpatients . 	INTRODUCTION : The GRADE working group has recently suggested a rigorous framework for clinical practice guidelines addressing diagnostic tests and test strategies based on the impact of alternative approaches on patient-important outcomes . The framework mandates explicit evidence summaries , ratings of the quality of evidence , and specifying recommendations as strong or weak . OBJECTIVES : To test the feasibility and performance of the GRADE approach , we applied this framework to well-researched issues in the diagnoses of deep venous thrombosis . METHODS : A 16-member panel with interest in thromboembolism and CPG development identified pertinent clinical questions . Our search for relevant studies included existing CPG and systematic reviews . We summarized the data in form of evidence tables and developed recommendations including , when needed , a formal consensus process . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS : We provide three groups of recommendations for clinicians practicing in settings with access to different types of D-dimer tests -- highly sensitive , moderately sensitive , and no availability of D-dimer . We consider the use of clinical prediction rules in guiding the diagnostic process , the potential for negative D-dimer or venous ultrasound to rule out disease , and the role of follow-up testing depending on the probability of DVT at the start of diagnostic process . We recommend the following : that clinicians without access to a highly or moderately sensitive D-dimer test rely on US to guide DVT diagnosis ; that those with access use the highly sensitive D-dimer to determine , in patients with low or moderate probability of DVT whether US is needed ; that in patients with low pre-test probability and a negative D-dimer they follow patients without further testing ; that in patients with high pre-test probability they perform a compression ultrasound without D-dimer testing . 	2009	2009-09-25	Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnƒôtrznej;2009 Sep;119;9;541-9;	Jaeschke,Roman,R;Gajewski,Piotr,P;Bates,Shannon M,SM;Douketis,James,J;Solnica,Bogdan,B;Crowther,Mark,M;Le≈õniak,Wiktoria,W;Brozek,Jan L,JL;Sch√ºnemann,Holger J,HJ;Zawilska,Krystyna,K;Tomkowski,Witold,W;Undas,Anetta,A;Sznajd,Jan,J;Nizankowski,Rafa≈Ç,R;Ba≈	-1.58536

UNLABELLED : Inclusion body myositis is a rare idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that produces remarkable muscle weakness . Resistance training with vascular occlusion has been shown to improve muscle strength and cross-sectional area in other muscle wasting conditions . PURPOSE : We evaluated the efficacy of a moderate-intensity resistance training program combined with vascular occlusion by examining functional capacity , muscle morphology , and changes in the expression of genes related to muscle protein synthesis and proteolysis in a patient with IBM . METHODS : A 65-yr-old man with IBM resistant to all proposed treatments underwent resistance training with vascular occlusion for 12 wk . Leg press one-repetition maximum ; thigh cross-sectional area ; balance , mobility , and muscle function ; quality of life ; and blood markers of inflammation and muscle damage were assessed at baseline and after the 12-wk program . The messenger RNA expression levels of mechanogrowth factor , mammalian target of rapamycin , atrogin-1 , and muscle RING finger-1 were also quantified . RESULTS : After the 12-wk training program , the patient &apos; s leg press one-repetition maximum , balance and mobility function , and thigh cross-sectional area increased 15.9 % , 60 % , and 4.7 % , respectively . All Short Form-36 Health Survey Questionnaire subscales demonstrated improvements as well , varying from 18 % to 600 % . mRNA expression of mechanogrowth factor increased 3.97-fold , whereas that of atrogin-1 decreased 0.62-fold . Muscle RING finger-1 and mammalian target of rapamycin mRNA levels were only slightly altered , 1.18- and 1.28-fold , respectively . Importantly , the exercise did not induce disease flare .

ERROR 19379952: 20018630	AIDS progression is associated with the emergence of IL-17-producing cells early after simian immunodeficiency virus infection . 	IL-17 is a potent effector cytokine involved in inflammatory response and antimicrobial defense . We report that SIV infection of rhesus macaques results in the emergence of IL-17-expressing cells during the acute phase . This subpopulation appears at day 14 postinfection concomitantly with an increase in TGF-beta and IL-18 expression . This subset , which exhibits phenotypic markers of NK T cells , rather than Th17 CD4 cells , persists during the chronic phase and is higher in noncontrollers SIV-infected RMs compared with controllers SIV-infected RMs . In contrast , in the nonpathogenic model of SIVagm infection of African green monkeys , no change in the level of IL-17-expressing cells is observed in lymphoid organs . Consistent with the emergence of TGF-beta and IL-18 during the acute phase in SIV-infected RMs , but not in SIV-infected African green monkeys , we demonstrate that in vitro TGF-beta and IL-18 induce the differentiation and expansion of IL-17+NKT+ . Altogether , these results demonstrate that IL-17-producing NKT are associated with the pathogenesis of SIV in RMs and suggest that TGF-beta and IL-18 play a role in their development . 	2009	2009-12-19	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);2010 Jan 15;184;2;984-92;	Campillo-Gimenez,Laure,L;Cumont,Marie-Christine,MC;Fay,Mich√®le,M;Kared,Hassen,H;Monceaux,Val√©rie,V;Diop,Ousmane,O;M√ºller-Trutwin,Michaela,M;Hurtrel,Bruno,B;L√©vy,Yves,Y;Zaunders,John,J;Dy,Michel,M;Leite-de-Moraes,Maria C,MC;Elbim,Carole,C;Estaquier,J√	-0.800958

The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activity of caulerpin was investigated . This bisindole alkaloid was isolated from the lipoid extract of Caulerpa racemosa and its structure was identified by spectroscopic methods , including IR and NMR techniques . The pharmacological assays used were the writhing and the hot plate tests , the formalin-induced pain , the capsaicin-induced ear edema and the carrageenan-induced peritonitis . Caulerpin was given orally at a concentration of 100 micromol / kg . In the abdominal constriction test caulerpin showed reduction in the acetic acid-induced nociception at 0.0945 micromol and for dypirone it was 0.0426 micromol . In the hot plate test in vivo the inhibition of nociception by caulerpin was also favorable . This result suggests that this compound exhibits a central activity , without changing the motor activity . Caulerpin reduced the formalin effects in both phases by 35.4 % and 45.6 % , respectively . The possible anti-inflammatory activity observed in the second phase in the formalin test of caulerpin was confirmed on the capsaicin-induced ear edema model , where an inhibition of 55.8 % was presented . Indeed , it was also observed in the carrageenan-induced peritonitis that caulerpin exhibited anti-inflammatory activity , reducing significantly the number of recruit cells by 48.3 % .

ERROR 19474460: 20121845	Biodiversity differences between managed and unmanaged forests : meta-analysis of species richness in Europe . 	Past and present pressures on forest resources have led to a drastic decrease in the surface area of unmanaged forests in Europe . Changes in forest structure , composition , and dynamics inevitably lead to changes in the biodiversity of forest-dwelling species . The possible biodiversity gains and losses due to forest management , however , have never been assessed at a pan-European scale . We used meta-analysis to review 49 published papers containing 120 individual comparisons of species richness between unmanaged and managed forests throughout Europe . We explored the response of different taxonomic groups and the variability of their response with respect to time since abandonment and intensity of forest management . Species richness was slightly higher in unmanaged than in managed forests . Species dependent on forest cover continuity , deadwood , and large trees and carabids were negatively affected by forest management . In contrast , vascular plant species were favored . The response for birds was heterogeneous and probably depended more on factors such as landscape patterns . The global difference in species richness between unmanaged and managed forests increased with time since abandonment and indicated a gradual recovery of biodiversity . Clearcut forests in which the composition of tree species changed had the strongest effect on species richness , but the effects of different types of management on taxa could not be assessed in a robust way because of low numbers of replications in the management-intensity classes . Our results show that some taxa are more affected by forestry than others , but there is a need for research into poorly studied species groups in Europe and in particular locations . Our meta-analysis supports the need for a coordinated European research network to study and monitor the biodiversity of different taxa in managed and unmanaged forests . 	2010	2010-02-04	Conservation biology : the journal of the Society for Conservation Biology;2010 Feb;24;1;101-12;	Paillet,Yoan,Y;Berg√®s,Laurent,L;Hj√§lt√©n,Joakim,J;Odor,P√©ter,P;Avon,Catherine,C;Bernhardt-R√∂mermann,Markus,M;Bijlsma,Rienk-Jan,RJ;De Bruyn,Luc,L;Fuhr,Marc,M;Grandin,Ulf,U;Kanka,Robert,R;Lundin,Lars,L;Luque,Sandra,S;Magura,Tibor,T;Matesanz,Silvia,S;M√	-1.67764

ERROR 19505199: 20154601	Infectious risk associated with arterial catheters compared with central venous catheters . 	BACKGROUND : Scheduled replacement of central venous catheters and , by extension , arterial catheters , is not recommended because the daily risk of catheter-related infection is considered constant over time after the first catheter days . Arterial catheters are considered at lower risk for catheter-related infection than central venous catheters in the absence of conclusive evidence . OBJECTIVES : To compare the daily risk and risk factors for colonization and catheter-related infection between arterial catheters and central venous catheters . METHODS : We used data from a trial of seven intensive care units evaluating different dressing change intervals and a chlorhexidine-impregnated sponge . We determined the daily hazard rate and identified risk factors for colonization using a marginal Cox model for clustered data . RESULTS : We included 3532 catheters and 27,541 catheter-days . Colonization rates did not differ between arterial catheters and central venous catheters . Arterial catheter and central venous catheter catheter-related infection rates were 0.68 % and 0.94 % , respectively . The daily hazard rate for colonization increased steadily over time for arterial catheters but remained stable for central venous catheters . Independent risk factors for arterial catheter colonization were respiratory failure and femoral insertion . Independent risk factors for central venous catheter colonization were trauma or absence of septic shock at intensive care unit admission , femoral or jugular insertion , and absence of antibiotic treatment at central venous catheter insertion . CONCLUSIONS : The risks of colonization and catheter-related infection did not differ between arterial catheters and central venous catheters , indicating that arterial catheter use should receive the same precautions as central venous catheter use . The daily risk was constant over time for central venous catheter after the fifth catheter day but increased significantly over time after the seventh day for arterial catheters . Randomized studies are needed to investigate the impact of scheduled arterial catheter replacement . 	2010	2010-02-16	Critical care medicine;2010 Apr;38;4;1030-5;	Lucet,Jean-Christophe,JC;Bouadma,Lila,L;Zahar,Jean-Ralph,JR;Schwebel,Carole,C;Geffroy,Arnaud,A;Pease,Sebastian,S;Herault,Marie-Christine,MC;Haouache,Hakim,H;Adrie,Christophe,C;Thuong,Marie,M;Fran√ßais,Adrien,A;Garrouste-Orgeas,Ma√Øt√©,M;Timsit,Jean-Fran√	-1.1093

Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and attacks of muscle atonia triggered by strong emotions . Narcolepsy is caused by hypocretin deficiency , paralleled by a dramatic loss in hypothalamic hypocretin-producing neurons . It is believed that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder , although definitive proof of this , such as the presence of autoantibodies , is still lacking . We engineered a transgenic mouse model to identify peptides enriched within hypocretin-producing neurons that could serve as potential autoimmune targets . Initial analysis indicated that the transcript encoding Tribbles homolog 2 , previously identified as an autoantigen in autoimmune uveitis , was enriched in hypocretin neurons in these mice . ELISA analysis showed that sera from narcolepsy patients with cataplexy had higher Trib2-specific antibody titers compared with either normal controls or patients with idiopathic hypersomnia , multiple sclerosis , or other inflammatory neurological disorders . Trib2-specific antibody titers were highest early after narcolepsy onset , sharply decreased within 2-3 years , and then stabilized at levels substantially higher than that of controls for up to 30 years . High Trib2-specific antibody titers correlated with the severity of cataplexy . Serum of a patient showed specific immunoreactivity with over 86 % of hypocretin neurons in the mouse hypothalamus . Thus , we have identified reactive autoantibodies in human narcolepsy , providing evidence that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disorder . 	2010	2010-02-18	The Journal of clinical investigation;2010 Mar;120;3;713-9;	Cvetkovic-Lopes,Vesna,V;Bayer,Laurence,L;Dorsaz,St√©phane,S;Maret,St√©phanie,S;Pradervand,Sylvain,S;Dauvilliers,Yves,Y;Lecendreux,Michel,M;Lammers,Gert-Jan,GJ;Donjacour,Claire E H M,CE;Du Pasquier,Renaud A,RA;Pfister,Corinne,C;Petit,Brice,B;Hor,Hyun,H;M√	-1.04655

We analyzed the attitude toward xenotransplantation among personnel in transplant-related services in several hospitals in Spain and Latin America . METHODS : A random sample stratified by type of service and job category , in transplant-related services was examined in eight hospital centers from three different countries : Spain , Mexico , and Cuba . A self-administered validated questionnaire was completed anonymously . RESULTS : Based on the assumption that all the results of xenotransplantation were similar to those achieved with human donors , most respondents would be in favor . The employees from Cuban centers had the most favorable attitudes , followed by the Spanish and the Mexicans . However , the differences were mainly determined by job category : Physicians showed the most favorable attitudes and auxiliary staff the least . Attitudes were significantly related to beliefs about different types of human donation , the possibility of needing a transplant for oneself , and a favorable attitude toward donating the organs of a deceased family member . CONCLUSIONS : Currently , a third of health care employees working in transplant-related services are not in favor of xenotransplantation .

ERROR 19562017: 20214475	Relative transmissibility of an R5 clade C simian-human immunodeficiency virus across different mucosae in macaques parallels the relative risks of sexual HIV-1 transmission in humans via different routes . 	BACKGROUND : Worldwide , approximately 90 % of all human immunodeficiency virus transmissions occur mucosally ; almost all involve R5 strains . Risks of sexual HIV acquisition are highest for rectal , then vaginal , and finally oral exposures . METHODS : Mucosal lacerations may affect the rank order of susceptibility to HIV but can not be assessed in humans . We measured relative virus transmissibility across intact mucosae in macaques using a single stock of SHIV-1157ipd3N4 , a simian-human immunodeficiency virus encoding a primary R5 HIV clade C env . RESULTS : The penetrability of rhesus macaque mucosae differed significantly , with rectal challenge requiring the least virus , followed by vaginal and then oral routes . These findings imply that intrinsic mucosal properties are responsible for the differential mucosal permeability . The latter paralleled the rank order reported for humans , with relative risk estimates within the range of epidemiological human studies . To test whether inflammation facilitates virus transmission -- as predicted from human studies -- we established a macaque model of localized buccal inflammation . Systemic infection occurred across inflamed but not normal buccal mucosa . CONCLUSION : Our primate data recapitulate virus transmission risks observed in humans , thus establishing R5 SHIV-1157ipd3N4 in macaques as a robust model system to study cofactors involved in human mucosal HIV transmission and its prevention . 	2010	2010-03-11	The Journal of infectious diseases;2010 Apr 15;201;8;1155-63;	Chenine,Agn√®s L,AL;Siddappa,Nagadenahalli B,NB;Kramer,Victor G,VG;Sciaranghella,Gaia,G;Rasmussen,Robert A,RA;Lee,Sandra J,SJ;Santosuosso,Michael,M;Poznansky,Mark C,MC;Velu,Vijayakumar,V;Amara,Rama R,RR;Souder,Chris,C;Anderson,Daniel C,DC;Villinger,Fran√	-1.14151

Analysis of striatal dopaminergic activity was conducted by regions of interest and statistical parametric mapping over normalized parametric images . Results : A progressive loss of striatal uptake was evident among groups for both radiotracers , which correlated significantly with the clinical motor status . Changes occurred earlier , i.e. in the less affected stages , with C-DTBZ . Similar results were achieved by ROI and SPM analysis . Uptake was similar with both radiotracers for the asymptomatic and recovered groups . Conclusions : Serial assessment with F-DOPA and C-DTBZ PETs provides an effective approach to evaluate evolution of dopaminergic depletion in monkeys with MPTP-induced parkinsonism . This approach could be useful to perform studies aiming to test the effect of early therapeutic intervention and putative neuroprotective treatments . 	2010	2010-03-23	Neurobiology of disease;2010 Jun;38;3;456-63;	Blesa,Javier,J;Juri,Carlos,C;Collantes,Mar√≠a,M;Pe√±uelas,Iv√°n,I;Prieto,Elena,E;Iglesias,Elena,E;Mart√≠-Climent,Josep,J;Arbizu,Javier,J;Zubieta,Jos√© L,JL;Rodr√≠guez-Oroz,Mari Cruz,MC;Garc√≠a-Garc√≠a,David,D;Richter,Jos√© A,JA;Cavada,Carmen,C;Obeso,Jos√	-1.41614
ERROR 19681945: 20339460	Efficacy of Artesunate + Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine and Amodiaquine + Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine for Uncomplicated falciparum Malaria in Equatorial Guinea . 	Objectives . The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy of combination drugs , such as artesunate + sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine + sulphadoxine-pyripethamine in treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria to differentiate recrudescence from reinfection by analysing msp-1 and msp-2 genes of Plasmodium falciparum in treatment failure cases . Methods . We carried out an in vivo study in the year 2005 in 206 children between 6 to 59 months age groups . Of the 206 , 120 received AQ + SP , and 86 received AS + SP . A clinical and parasitological followup during 14 days was undertaken . Finger-prick blood sample from each patient was taken on Whatman filter paper on days 0 , 7 , 14 and also the day when the parasite and symptoms reappeared for PCR analysis . Results . Late treatment failure was observed in 3.5 % with AQ + SP , and 2.5 % with AS + SP . The success rate was 96.5 % with AQ + SP and 97.5 % with AS + SP . No deaths and severe reactions were recorded . Out of the 6 treatment failure cases , one was reinfection as observed by PCR analysis of msp-1 and msp-2 genes on day 14 . Discussion . Both the combinations found to be efficacious and safe and could be used as a first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Equatorial Guinea . 	2009	2009-01-01	Journal of tropical medicine;2009;2009;;781865;	Charle,Pilar,P;Berzosa,Pedro,P;Descalzo,Miguel Angel,MA;de Lucio,Aida,A;Raso,Jose,J;Obono,Jacqueline,J;Lwanga,Magdalena,M;Nlang,Natividad,N;Nchama,Araceli,A;Mangue,Catalina,C;Micha,Anastasio,A;Nsee,Natividad,N;Mesie,Rosario,R;Benito,Agust√≠n,A;Roche,Jes√	-1.08516
ERROR 19692714: 20350704	Effects of adipose tissue-derived stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction : impact of the route of administration . 	BACKGROUND : Cell-based therapies offer a promising approach to reducing the short-term mortality rate associated with heart failure after a myocardial infarction . The aim of the study was to analyze histological and functional effects of adipose tissue-derived stem cells after myocardial infarction and compare 2 types of administration pathways . METHODS AND RESULTS : ADSCs from 28 pigs were labeled by transfection . Animals that survived myocardial infarction received : intracoronary culture media ; intracoronary ADSCs ; transendocardial culture media ; or transendocardial ADSCs . At 3 weeks &apos; follow-up , intracoronary and transendocardial administration of ADSCs resulted in similar rates of engrafted cells and some of those cells expressed smooth muscle cell markers . The intracoronary administration of ADSCs was more effective in increasing the number of small vessels than transendocardial administration . Ejection fraction was not modified by stem cell therapy . CONCLUSIONS : This is the first study to compare intracoronary and transendocardial administration of autologous ADSCs in a porcine model of myocardial infarction . Both pathways of ADSCs delivery are feasible , producing a similar number of engrafted and differentiated cells , although intracoronary administration was more effective in increasing neovascularization . 	2010	2010-03-31	Journal of cardiac failure;2010 Apr;16;4;357-66;	Rigol,Montserrat,M;Solanes,N√∫ria,N;Farr√©,Jordi,J;Roura,Santiago,S;Roqu√©,Merc√®,M;Berruezo,Antonio,A;Bellera,Neus,N;Novens√†,Laura,L;Tamborero,David,D;Prat-Vidal,Cristina,C;Huzman,M A Angeles,MA;Batlle,Montserrat,M;Hoefsloot,Margo,M;Sitges,Marta,M;Ram√	-1.13139

In this study , we investigated the oxidative stress influence in some prosurvival and proapoptotic proteins after myocardial infarction . Male Wistar rats were divided in two groups : Sham-operated and MI . MI was induced by left coronary artery occlusion . 28-days after surgery , echocardiographic , morphometric , and hemodynamic parameters were evaluated . Redox status and hydrogen peroxide levels were measured in heart tissue . The p-ERK / ERK , p-Akt / Akt , p-mTOR / mTOR and p-GSK-3beta / GSK-3beta ratios , as well as apoptosis-inducing factor myocardial protein expression were quantified by Western blot . MI group showed an increase in cardiac hypertrophy associated with a decrease in ejection fraction and increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure when compared to control , characterizing ventricular dysfunction . Redox status imbalance was seen in MI animals , as evidenced by the decrease in the GSH / GSSG ratio and increased levels of HO . This group also showed an increase in the ERK phosphorylation and a reduction of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation when compared to control . Moreover , we showed a reduction in the GSK-3beta phosphorylation and an increase in AIF protein expression in MI group . Taken together , our results show increased HO levels and cellular redox imbalance associated to a higher p-ERK and AIF immunocontent , which would contribute to a maladaptive hypertrophy phenotype . 	2010	2010-03-31	Molecular and cellular biochemistry;2010 Aug;341;1-2;1-8;	Schenkel,Paulo Cavalheiro,PC;Tavares,Angela Maria Vicente,AM;Fernandes,Rafael Oliveira,RO;Diniz,Gabriela Placon√°,GP;Bertagnolli,Mariane,M;da Rosa Araujo,Alex Sander,AS;Barreto-Chaves,Maria Luiza,ML;Ribeiro,Maria Flavia Marques,MF;Clausell,Nadine,N;Bell√	-1.00268
ERROR 19704746: 20363376	Sequence variation of ookinete surface proteins Pvs25 and Pvs28 of Plasmodium vivax isolates from Southern Mexico and their association to local anophelines infectivity . 	The polymorphism of Pvs25 and Pvs28 ookinete surface proteins , their association to circumsporozoite protein repeat genotypes and their infectivity to local Anopheles albimanus and Anopheles pseudopunctipennis were investigated in Plasmodium vivax-infected blood samples obtained from patients in Southern Mexico . The pvs25 and pvs28 complete genes were amplified , cloned and sequenced ; and the CSPr genotype was determined by PCR amplification and hybridization . The amino acid Pvs25 and Pvs28 polymorphisms were mapped to their corresponding protein structure . Infected blood samples were simultaneously provided through artificial feeders to both mosquito species ; the ratio of infected mosquitoes and oocyst numbers were recorded . The polymorphism of pvs25 and pvs28 was limited to few nucleotide positions , and produced three haplotypes : type A / A parasites presented Pvs25 and Pvs28 amino acid sequences identical to that of Sal I reference strain ; parasites type B1 presented a mutation 130 Ile -- &gt; Thr in Pvs25 , while type B2 presented 87 Gln -- &gt; Lys / 130 Ile -- &gt; Thr in the same molecule . Both types B1 and B2 parasites presented changes in Pvs28 at 87 Asn -- &gt; Asp , 110 Tyr -- &gt; Asn and five GSGGE / D repeat sequences between the fourth EGF-like domain and the GPI . Most P. vivaxparasites from the coastal plains and the overlapping region were Pvs25 / 28 A / A , CSPrVk210 and were infective only to An. albimanus . Parasites originating in foothills were Pvs25 / 28 type B1 / B or B2 / B and CSPrVk210 or Vk247 , and were more infective to An. pseudopunctipennis than to An. albimanus . These results and the analysis of Pvs25 / 28 from other parts of the world indicated that non-synonymous variations in these proteins occur in amino acid residues exposed on the surface of the proteins , and are likely to interact with midgut mosquito ligands . We hypothesize that these molecules have been shaped by co-evolutionary adaptations of parasites to their susceptible vectors . 	2010	2010-04-07	Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases;2010 Jul;10;5;645-54;	Gonz√°lez-Cer√≥n,Lilia,L;Alvarado-Delgado,Alejandro,A;Mart√≠nez-Barnetche,Jesus,J;Rodr√≠guez,Mario H,MH;Ovilla-Mu√±oz,Marbella,M;P√©rez,Fabi√°n,F;Hernandez-Avila,Juan E,JE;Sandoval,Marco A,MA;Rodr√≠guez,Maria Del Carmen,Mdel C;Villarreal-Trevi√±o,Cuauht√	-0.699945

Cardiomyocytes generated from embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells are suggested for repopulation of destroyed myocardium . Because contractile properties are crucial for functional regeneration , we compared cardiomyocytes differentiated from ES cells and iPS cells . Native myocardium served as control . Murine ESCs or iPS cells were differentiated 11 d in vitro and cocultured 5-7 d with irreversibly injured myocardial tissue slices . Vital embryonic ventricular tissue slices of similar age served for comparison . Force-frequency relationship , effects of Ca , Ni , nifedipine , ryanodine , beta-adrenergic , and muscarinic modulation were studied during loaded contractions . FFR was negative for ESC-CMs and iPS-CMs . FFR was positive for embryonic tissue and turned negative after treatment with ryanodine . In all groups , force of contraction and relaxation time increased with the concentration of Ca and decreased with nifedipine . Force was reduced by Ni . Isoproterenol increased the force most pronounced in embryonic tissue . EC values were similar . Contractile properties of iPS-CMs and ESC-CMs were similar , but they were significantly different from ventricular tissue of comparable age .

ERROR 19712637: 20371695	Establishment and characterization of a panel of human uveal melanoma xenografts derived from primary and/or metastatic tumors . 	PURPOSE : Uveal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignant tumor in adults and is defined by a poor natural outcome , as 50 % of patients die from metastases . The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a panel of human uveal melanoma xenografts transplanted into immunodeficient mice . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : Ninety tumor specimens were grafted into severe combined immunodeficient mice , and 25 transplantable xenografts were then established . Relationship between tumor graft and clinical , biological , and therapeutic features of the patients included were investigated . Characterization of 16 xenografts included histology , molecular analyses by immunohistochemistry , genetic alteration analysis , and specific tumor antigen expression by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR . Pharmacologic characterization was also done in four models using two drugs , temozolomide and fotemustine , currently used in the clinical management of uveal melanoma . RESULTS : Take rate of human uveal melanoma was 28 % . Tumor take was independent of size , histologic parameters , or chromosome 3 monosomy but was significantly higher in metastatic tumors . Interestingly , in vivo tumor growth was prognostic for a lower metastasis-free survival in patients with primary tumors . A high concordance between the patients &apos; tumors and their corresponding xenografts was found for all parameters tested . Finally , the four xenografts studied displayed different response profiles to chemotherapeutic agents . CONCLUSIONS : Based on these results , this panel of 16 uveal melanoma xenografts represents a useful preclinical tool for both pharmacologic and biological assessments . 	2010	2010-04-08	Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research;2010 Apr 15;16;8;2352-62;	N√©mati,Fariba,F;Sastre-Garau,Xavier,X;Laurent,C√©cile,C;Couturier,J√©r√¥me,J;Mariani,Pascale,P;Desjardins,Laurence,L;Piperno-Neumann,Sophie,S;Lantz,Olivier,O;Asselain,Bernard,B;Plancher,Corine,C;Robert,Delphine,D;P√©guillet,Isabelle,I;Donnadieu,Marie-H√	-1.69826
ERROR 19731307: 20391423	Evaluation of fetuses in a study of intravenous immunoglobulin as preventive therapy for congenital heart block : Results of a multicenter , prospective , open-label clinical trial . 	OBJECTIVE : The recurrence rate of anti-SSA / Ro-associated congenital heart block is 17 % . Sustained reversal of third-degree block has never been achieved . Based on potential reduction of maternal autoantibody titers as well as fetal inflammatory responses , intravenous immunoglobulin was evaluated as preventive therapy for CHB . METHODS : A multicenter , prospective , open-label study based on Simon &apos; s 2-stage optimal design was initiated . Enrollment criteria included the presence of anti-SSA / Ro antibodies in the mother , birth of a previous child with CHB / neonatal lupus rash , current treatment with &lt; or = 20 mg / day of prednisone , and &lt; 12 weeks pregnant . IVIG was given every 3 weeks from week 12 to week 24 of gestation . The primary outcome was the development of second-degree or third-degree CHB . RESULTS : Twenty mothers completed the IVIG protocol before the predetermined stopping rule of 3 cases of advanced CHB in the study was reached . CHB was detected at 19 , 20 , and 25 weeks ; none of the cases occurred following the finding of an abnormal PR interval on fetal Doppler monitoring . One of these mothers had 2 previous children with CHB . One child without CHB developed a transient rash consistent with neonatal lupus . Sixteen children had no manifestations of neonatal lupus at birth . No significant changes in maternal titers of antibody to SSA / Ro , SSB / La , or Ro 52 kd were detected over the course of therapy or at delivery . There were no safety issues . CONCLUSION : This study establishes the safety of IVIG and the feasibility of recruiting pregnant women who have previously had a child with CHB . However , IVIG at low doses consistent with replacement does not prevent the recurrence of CHB or reduce maternal antibody titers . 	2010	2010-04-15	Arthritis and rheumatism;2010 Apr;62;4;1138-46;	Friedman,Deborah M,DM;Llanos,Carolina,C;Izmirly,Peter M,PM;Brock,Brigit,B;Byron,John,J;Copel,Joshua,J;Cummiskey,Karen,K;Dooley,Mary Anne,MA;Foley,Jill,J;Graves,Cornelia,C;Hendershott,Colleen,C;Kates,Richard,R;Komissarova,Elena V,EV;Miller,Michelle,M;Par√	-1.19971
ERROR 19734437: 20394757	Effects of 17beta-estradiol replacement on the apoptotic effects caused by ovariectomy in the rat hippocampus . 	AIMS : The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different periods of ovariectomy and 17beta-estradiol replacement on apoptotic cell death and expression of members of the Bcl-2 family in the rat hippocampus . MAIN METHODS : Hippocampi were obtained from rats in proestrus , ovariectomized , ovariectomized for 15 days and then treated with 17beta-estradiol for 7 or 21 days , and rats ovariectomized and immediately treated with 17beta-estradiol for 21 days . The expression of Bcl-2 and Bax and the number of apoptotic cells were determined . KEY FINDINGS : Ovariectomy decreased Bcl-2 expression and increased Bax expression and the number of apoptotic cells . Replacement with 17beta-estradiol throughout the post-ovariectomy period reduced the number of apoptotic cells to the control levels , and prevented the effects of ovariectomy on Bax expression , but only partially restored the Bcl-2 expression . After 15 days of ovariectomy , the replacement with 17beta-estradiol for 21 days , but not for 7 days , restored the Bcl-2 and Bax expression and the percentage of apoptotic cells to the levels found in the proestrus control . SIGNIFICANCE : The present results show that a physiological concentration of 17beta-estradiol may help maintain long-term neuronal viability by regulating the expression of members of the Bcl-2 family . Even after a period of hormonal deprivation , treatment with 17beta-estradiol is able to restore the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 to control levels , but the duration of the treatment is a key factor to obtain the desired effect . These data provide new understanding into the mechanisms contributing to the neuroprotective action of estrogen . 	2010	2010-04-17	Life sciences;2010 May 22;86;21-22;832-8;	Sales,Sayuri,S;Ureshino,Rodrigo Portes,RP;Pereira,Renato Tavares dos Santos,RT;Luna,Milene Schmidt Amaral,MS;Pires de Oliveira,Marcelo,M;Yamanouye,Norma,N;Godinho,Rosely Oliveira,RO;Smaili,Soraya Soubhi,SS;Porto,Catarina Segreti,CS;Abdalla,Fernando Maur√	-1.19558
ERROR 19739071: 20399562	Pharmacological activation of 5-HT7 receptors reduces nerve injury-induced mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity . 	The involvement of the 5-HT receptor in nociception and pain , particularly chronic pain , has been poorly investigated . In the present study , we examined whether the 5-HT receptor participates in some modulatory control of nerve injury-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity and thermal hyperalgesia in mice . Activation of 5-HT receptors by systemic administration of the selective 5-HT receptor agonist AS-19 exerted a clear-cut reduction of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities that were reversed by co-administering the selective 5-HT receptor antagonist SB-258719 . Interestingly , blocking of 5-HT receptors with SB-258719 enhanced mechanical hypersensitivity in nerve-injured mice and induced mechanical hypersensitivity in sham-operated mice . Effectiveness of the treatment with a 5-HT receptor agonist was maintained after repeated systemic administration : no tolerance to the antiallodynic and antihyperalgesic effects was developed following treatment with the selective 5-HT receptor agonist E-57431 twice daily for 11 days . The 5-HT receptor co-localized with GABAergic cells in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord , suggesting that the activation of spinal inhibitory GABAergic interneurons could contribute to the analgesic effects of 5-HT receptor agonists . In addition , a significant increase of 5-HT receptors was found by immunohistochemistry in the ipsilateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord after nerve injury , suggesting a &quot; pain &quot; -triggered regulation of receptor expression . These results support the idea that the 5-HT receptor subtype is involved in the control of pain and point to a new potential use of 5-HT receptor agonists for the treatment of neuropathic pain . 	2010	2010-04-20	Pain;2010 Jun;149;3;483-94;	Brenchat,Alex,A;Nadal,Xavier,X;Romero,Luz,L;Ovalle,Sergio,S;Muro,Asunci√≥n,A;S√°nchez-Arroyos,Ricard,R;Portillo-Salido,Enrique,E;Pujol,Marta,M;Montero,Ana,A;Codony,Xavier,X;Burgue√±o,Javier,J;Zamanillo,Daniel,D;Hamon,Michel,M;Maldonado,Rafael,R;Vela,Jos√	-1.34109

The time between drug intake and skin symptoms was , on average , two days . Beside these classical characteristics , some original findings were found including , a frequent non pigmentation course and a sex-dependent pattern of distribution . Women often had lesions on the hands and feet , and men on the genitalia . Given the fact that skin pigmentation is an inconstant feature of FDE , its French name should be reconsidered .

ERROR 19843533: 20509860	Genetic inactivation of the Fanconi anemia gene FANCC identified in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HuH-7 confers sensitivity towards DNA-interstrand crosslinking agents . 	BACKGROUND : Inactivation of the Fanconi anemia pathway through defects in one of 13 FA genes occurs at low frequency in various solid cancer entities among the general population . As FA pathway inactivation confers a distinct hypersensitivity towards DNA interstrand-crosslinking -agents , FA defects represent rational targets for individualized therapeutic strategies . Except for pancreatic cancer , however , the prevalence of FA defects in gastrointestinal tumors has not yet been systematically explored . RESULTS : A panel of GI cancer cell lines was screened for FA pathway inactivation applying FANCD2 monoubiquitination and FANCD2 / RAD51 nuclear focus formation and a newly identified FA pathway-deficient cell line was functionally characterized . The hepatocellular carcinoma line HuH-7 was defective in FANCD2 monoubiquitination and FANCD2 nuclear focus formation but proficient in RAD51 focus formation . Gene complementation studies revealed that this proximal FA pathway inactivation was attributable to defective FANCC function in HuH-7 cells . Accordingly , a homozygous inactivating FANCC nonsense mutation was identified in HuH-7 , resulting in partial transcriptional skipping of exon 6 and leading to the classic cellular FA hypersensitivity phenotype ; HuH-7 cells exhibited a strongly reduced proliferation rate and a pronounced G2 cell cycle arrest at distinctly lower concentrations of ICL-agents than a panel of non-isogenic , FA pathway-proficient HCC cell lines . Upon retroviral transduction of HuH-7 cells with FANCC cDNA , FA pathway functions were restored and ICL-hypersensitivity abrogated . Analyses of 18 surgical HCC specimens yielded no further examples for genetic or epigenetic inactivation of FANCC , FANCF , or FANCG in HCC , suggesting a low prevalence of proximal FA pathway inactivation in this tumor type . CONCLUSIONS : As the majority of HCC are chemoresistant , assessment of FA pathway function in HCC could identify small subpopulations of patients expected to predictably benefit from individualized treatment protocols using ICL-agents . 	2010	2010-06-01	Molecular cancer;2010;9;;127;	Palagyi,Andreas,A;Neveling,Kornelia,K;Plinninger,Ursula,U;Ziesch,Andreas,A;Targosz,Bianca-Sabrina,BS;Denk,Gerald U,GU;Ochs,Stephanie,S;Rizzani,Antonia,A;Meier,Daniel,D;Thasler,Wolfgang E,WE;Hanenberg,Helmut,H;De Toni,Enrico N,EN;Bassermann,Florian,F;Sch√	-1.1749
ERROR 19843875: 20510213	Predicting late myocardial recovery and outcomes in the early hours of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction traditional measures compared with microvascular obstruction , salvaged myocardium , and necrosis characteristics by cardiovascular magnetic resonance . 	OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to determine whether a very early imaging strategy improves the prediction of late systolic dysfunction and poor outcomes in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction compared with traditional predictors . BACKGROUND : Earlier prediction of poor outcomes after STEMI is desirable , because it will allow tailored therapy at the earliest possible time , when benefits might be greatest . METHODS : One hundred and three patients with acute STEMI were studied by contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance within 12 h of primary angioplasty and at 6 months and followed &gt; 2 years . The primary end point was left ventricular dysfunction , whereas poor outcomes were a key secondary end point . RESULTS : Traditional risk factors were only modest predictors of late LV dysfunction . Late gadolinium enhancement volume maintained a stronger association to LV ejection fraction change than infarct transmurality , microvascular obstruction , or myocardial salvage during STEMI . Multivariable logistic regression identified LGE volume during STEMI as the best predictor of late LV dysfunction . An LGE &gt; or=23 % of LV during STEMI accurately predicted late LV dysfunction . The LGE volume provided important incremental benefit for predicting late dysfunction . Twenty-three patients developed poor outcomes over 2.6 +/- 0.9 years ; LGE volume remained a strong independent predictor of poor outcomes , whereas LGE &gt; or=23 % carried a hazard ratio of 6.1 for adverse events . CONCLUSIONS : During the hyperacute phase of STEMI , LGE volume provides the strongest association and incremental predictive value for late systolic dysfunction and discerns poor late outcomes . 	2010	2010-06-01	Journal of the American College of Cardiology;2010 Jun 1;55;22;2459-69;	Larose,Eric,E;Rod√©s-Cabau,Josep,J;Pibarot,Philippe,P;Rinfret,St√©phane,S;Proulx,Guy,G;Nguyen,Can M,CM;D√©ry,Jean-Pierre,JP;Gleeton,Onil,O;Roy,Louis,L;No√´l,Bernard,B;Barbeau,G√©rald,G;Rouleau,Jacques,J;Boudreault,Jean-Rock,JR;Amyot,Marc,M;De Larochelli√	-1.34593

ERROR 19867695: 20536205	Alignment and relaxation dynamics of dye molecules in host-guest inclusion compounds as probed by dielectric spectroscopy . 	The alignment and relaxation dynamics of a polar dye molecule , N , N-dimethyl-4aniline , in zeolite L and perhydrotriphenylene channels were investigated by means of a combination of optical , dielectric , and quantum-chemical methods . Both the zeolite L and PHTP channels enable the dye molecules to align along the channel axis . An amplified net dipole moment of DNAA in PHTP is observed and attributed to enhanced 1D close alignment of dye molecules . In zeolite L channels , a concentration gradient is found with aggregation at the channel entrances . The dynamics of the dye in zeolite L channels reveals localized conical rotational fluctuation modes following Arrhenius-type activation with energy of 0.31 eV , which we assign to small noninteracting fluctuating polar units of the dyes being loosely aligned or isolated . Unlike zeolite L , relaxations in PHTP are characterized by cooperative wobbling motions interpreted as increased intermolecular dipole interaction due to a closely packed one-dimensional array . Temperature-dependent activation energies of 0.25 eV below 0 degrees C and 0.37 eV at ambient temperature reflect the role of the soft channel walls in the activation process . 	2010	2010-06-12	The journal of physical chemistry.

ERROR 19874440: 20543203	Germline mutations of the CBL gene define a new genetic syndrome with predisposition to juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia . 	BACKGROUND : CBL missense mutations have recently been associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia , an aggressive myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic neoplasm of early childhood characterised by excessive macrophage / monocyte proliferation . CBL , an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a multi-adaptor protein , controls proliferative signalling networks by downregulating the growth factor receptor signalling cascades in various cell types . METHODS AND RESULTS : CBL mutations were screened in 65 patients with JMML . A homozygous mutation of CBL was found in leukaemic cells of 4 / 65 patients . In all cases , copy neutral loss of heterozygosity of the 11q23 chromosomal region , encompassing the CBL locus , was demonstrated . Three of these four patients displayed additional features suggestive of an underlying developmental condition . A heterozygous germline CBL p.Y371H substitution was found in each of them and was inherited from the father in one patient . The germline mutation represents the first hit , with somatic loss of heterozygosity being the second hit positively selected in JMML cells . The three patients display a variable combination of dysmorphic features , hyperpigmented skin lesions and microcephaly that enable a &apos; CBL syndrome &apos; to be tentatively delineated . Learning difficulties and postnatal growth retardation may be part of the phenotype . CONCLUSION : A report of germline mutations of CBL in three patients with JMML is presented here , confirming the existence of an unreported inheritable condition associated with a predisposition to JMML . 	2010	2010-06-15	Journal of medical genetics;2010 Oct;47;10;686-91;	P√©rez,B,B;Mechinaud,F,F;Galambrun,C,C;Ben Romdhane,N,N;Isidor,B,B;Philip,N,N;Derain-Court,J,J;Cassinat,B,B;Lachenaud,J,J;Kaltenbach,S,S;Salmon,A,A;D√©sir√©e,C,C;Pereira,S,S;Menot,M L,ML;Royer,N,N;Fenneteau,O,O;Baruchel,A,A;Chomienne,C,C;Verloes,A,A;Cav√	-0.799574

Human HAVCR1 gene maps on 5q33.2 , a region linked with susceptibility to allergic and autoimmune diseases . The aims of the present study were to define the haplotypes of HAVCR1 gene taking into account both HapMap Project SNP haplotypes and exon 4 variants , to investigate a possible relationship between these haplotypes and mRNA expression levels , and to assess whether HAVCR1 gene is involved in susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus . Genotyping of three ins / del variants in the exon 4 was performed by fragment length analysis . Five tag SNPs genotypes and mRNA levels were determined using TaqMan assays . We defined four major haplotypes in our population : the two major haplotypes bear both the 5383-5397del variant and the two most common SNP sets found in the CEU population . Quantification analysis revealed that genotype B / B had the highest median of mRNA expression levels . Additionally , frequency of the genotype BB was significantly higher in RA patients than in controls . Our results support a relationship between HAVCR1 haplotypes and mRNA expression levels , and suggest an association of this gene with autoimmune diseases . 	2010	2010-06-16	Human genetics;2010 Aug;128;2;221-9;	Garc√≠a-Lozano,Jos√© Ra√∫l,JR;Abad,Cristina,C;Escalera,Ana,A;Torres,Bel√©n,B;Fern√°ndez,Olga,O;Garc√≠a,Alicia,A;S√°nchez-Rom√°n,Julio,J;Sabio,Jos√©-Mario,JM;Ortego-Centeno,Norberto,N;Raya-Alvarez,Enrique,E;N√∫√±ez-Rold√°n,Antonio,A;Mart√≠n,Javier,J;Gonz√	-1.07598

ERROR 19911050: 20581770	Organ-related cigarette smoke-induced oxidative stress is strain-dependent . 	BACKGROUND : Cigarette smoke is associated with oxidative stress in several organs because it contains high concentrations of free radicals and reactive oxygen species . Experimental models , using different strains , provide important insights into the genetic basis of diseases . This study sought to identify , in different mouse strains , the organ that is most-susceptible to CS-induced oxidative stress to obtain an optimized experimental animal model of oxidative injury induced by CS . MATERIAL / METHODS : Male Swiss , DBA / 2 , C3H , BALB / c , and C57BL / 6 mice were exposed to CS 3 times a day for 60 consecutive days . Control groups from the same strains were sham-treated . Protein content , malondialdehyde level , myeloperoxidase activity , and nitrite level were assayed in lung , liver , kidney , and brain from all strains . Catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were measured . Analyses of data were done by using a 1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni &apos; s post-test . RESULTS : Cigarette smoke exposure resulted in distinct , organ-specific responses among strains . The survival rate of DBA / 2 mice was lowest . BALB / c and C57BL / 6 strains were more-susceptible to oxidative damage in the lung and liver . C3H and C57BL / 6 mice were more-susceptible to oxidative damage in the brain . No renal oxidative damage was seen . CONCLUSIONS : Mouse strains and individual organs display a range of susceptibilities to CS-induced oxidative stress . BALB / c and C57BL / 6 strains appear to be the best choices as experimental models for studying CS effects on liver and lung , and C3H and C57BL / 6 strains for CS-effects on the brain . 	2010	2010-06-29	Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research;2010 Jul;16;7;BR218-26;	Rueff-Barroso,Carlos Romualdo,CR;Trajano,Eduardo Tavares Lima,ET;Alves,Jackson Nogueira,JN;Paiva,Rojane Oliveira,RO;Lanzetti,Manuella,M;Pires,Karla Maria Pereira,KM;Bezerra,Frank Silva,FS;Pinho,Ricardo Aurino,RA;Valenca,Samuel Santos,SS;Porto,Luis Crist√	-1.23488
ERROR 19923467: 20594896	Indications of glucocorticoids in early arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis : recommendations for clinical practice based on data from the literature and expert opinion . 	OBJECTIVE : To develop clinical practice guidelines about the indications of glucocorticoid therapy in early arthritis and established rheumatoid arthritis , based on previously published data and on the opinions of rheumatology experts . METHODS : We used a three-step procedure . A scientific committee used a Delphi procedure to select three questions about glucocorticoid indications : what is the role for glucocorticoid therapy in early arthritis ? What is the role for long-term glucocorticoid therapy in established rheumatoid arthritis ? What is the role for systemic glucocorticoid therapy in flares of rheumatoid arthritis ? Evidence providing answers to the three questions was sought in Pubmed , Embase , Cochrane , and abstracts from the annual meetings of the ACR and EULAR . Based on this evidence , recommendations were developed and validated by a panel of experts . The strength of each recommendation was determined based on the level of the underlying evidence . The level of agreement among experts regarding each recommendation was measured . RESULTS : The literature search retrieved 2851 publications , of which 36 were selected based on the titles and abstracts then on the full-length articles . These 36 studies were presented to the experts as a basis for discussion . Six recommendations rated A to D were developed and validated by the experts . They dealt with the appropriateness of low- or moderate-dose glucocorticoid therapy for a limited period in early polyarthritis after advice from a specialist and in the event of active disease , in combination with disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy ; the appropriateness of low-dose glucocorticoid therapy in RA if needed to achieve symptom control ; and the appropriateness of oral glucocorticoid therapy for 1 to 2 weeks in polyarticular flares of RA . CONCLUSION : The six recommendations for everyday practice presented here should help to standardize and to optimize clinical practice , thereby improving the management of patients with early arthritis or RA . 	2010	2010-07-03	Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme;2010 Dec;77;6;597-603;	Mouterde,Ga√´l,G;Dernis,Emmanuelle,E;Ruyssen-Witrand,Adeline,A;Claudepierre,Pascal,P;Schaeverbeke,Thierry,T;Cantagrel,Alain,A;Gaudin,Philippe,P;Maillefert,Jean-Francis,JF;Pham,Thao,T;Saraux,Alain,A;Tebib,Jacques,J;Wendling,Daniel,D;Fautrel,Bruno,B;Le Lo√	-1.08498
ERROR 19961446: 20637200	A polymorphism near IL28B is associated with spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C virus and jaundice . 	BACKGROUND &amp; # 38 ; AIMS : A single nucleotide polymorphism upstream of the IL28B gene has been associated with response of patients with chronic hepatitis C to therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin and also with spontaneous clearance of acute hepatitis C in a heterogeneous population . We analyzed the association between IL28B and the clinical presentation of acute hepatitis C virus infection in a homogeneous population . METHODS : We analyzed the SNP rs12979860 in 190 women from the German anti-D cohort and its association with spontaneous clearance . Clinical data were available in 136 women with acute infection who were also evaluated for IL28B genotype . Based on results of a TaqMan polymerase chain reaction assay , the rs12979860 SNP genotypes studied were C / C , C / T , or T / T . RESULTS : Spontaneous clearance was more common in patients with the C / C genotype compared with C / T or T / T . Jaundice during acute infection was more common among patients with C / C genotype than non-C / C patients . In C / C patients , jaundice during acute infection was not associated with an increased chance of spontaneous clearance compared with those without jaundice . In contrast , in non-C / C patients , jaundice was associated with a higher likelihood of spontaneous clearance compared with those without jaundice . CONCLUSIONS : The SNP rs12979860 upstream of IL28B is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV . Women with the C / T or T / T genotype who did not develop jaundice had a lower chance of spontaneous clearance of HCV infection . 	2010	2010-07-20	Gastroenterology;2010 Nov;139;5;1586-92, 1592.e1;	Tillmann,Hans L,HL;Thompson,Alex J,AJ;Patel,Keyur,K;Wiese,Manfred,M;Tenckhoff,Hannelore,H;Nischalke,Hans D,HD;Lokhnygina,Yuliya,Y;Kullig,Ulrike,U;G√∂bel,Uwe,U;Capka,Emanuela,E;Wiegand,Johannes,J;Schiefke,Ingolf,I;G√ºthoff,Wolfgang,W;Gr√ºngreiff,Kurt,K;K√	-0.908346

The biological evaluation showed that some of these molecules were modest inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase , in the micromolar range . The 2-amino , and 2-chloro derivatives 21-23 , 25 , 26 were AChE selective inhibitors , whereas 2-amino derivatives 5 , 14 proved to be selective for BuChE . Only inhibitor 24 was equipotent for both cholinesterases . Kinetic studies on compound 23 showed that this compound is a mixed-type inhibitor of AChE showing a K of 6.33 microM. No clear SAR can be obtained form these data , but apparently , compounds bearing small groups such as the N , N &apos; -dimethylamino or the pyrrolidino , regardless of the presence of a 2-amino , or 6-chloro substituent in the pyridine ring , preferentially inhibit AChE . Molecular modeling on inhibitors 4 , 5 , 22 , and 23 has been carried out to give a better insight into the binding mode on the catalytic active site , and peripheral anionic site of AChE . The most important differences in the observed binding relay on the modifications of the group at C2 , as the amino group forms two hydrogen bonds that direct the binding mode , while in the case of compounds with a chlorine atom , this is not possible . The neuroprotective profile of these molecules has been investigated . In the LDH test , only compounds 26 , 3 , 22 , and 24 showed neuroprotection with values in the range 37.8-31.6 % in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stressed with a mixture of oligomycin-A / rotenone , but in the MTT test only compound 17 showed a similar profile .

The recent pandemic caused by human influenza virus A 2009 contains ancestral gene segments from North American and Eurasian swine lineages as well as from avian and human influenza lineages . The emergence of this A 2009 poses a potential global threat for human health and the fact that it can infect other species , like pigs , favours a possible encounter with other influenza viruses circulating in swine herds . In Europe , H1N1 , H1N2 and H3N2 subtypes of swine influenza virus currently have a high prevalence in commercial farms . To better assess the risk posed by the A 2009 in the actual situation of swine farms , we sought to analyze whether a previous infection with a circulating European avian-like swine A / Swine / Spain / 53207 / 2004 influenza virus generated or not cross-protective immunity against a subsequent infection with the new human pandemic A / Catalonia / 63 / 2009 influenza virus 21 days apart . Pigs infected only with pH1N1 had mild to moderate pathological findings , consisting on broncho-interstitial pneumonia . However , pigs inoculated with SwH1N1 virus and subsequently infected with pH1N1 had very mild lung lesions , apparently attributed to the remaining lesions caused by SwH1N1 infection . These later pigs also exhibited boosted levels of specific antibodies . Finally , animals firstly infected with SwH1N1 virus and latter infected with pH1N1 exhibited undetectable viral RNA load in nasal swabs and lungs after challenge with pH1N1 , indicating a cross-protective effect between both strains . 	2010	2010-07-29	Veterinary research;2010 Sep-Oct;41;5;74;	Busquets,N√∫ria,N;Segal√©s,Joaquim,J;C√≥rdoba,Lorena,L;Muss√°,Tufaria,T;Crisci,Elisa,E;Mart√≠n-Valls,Gerard E,GE;Simon-Grif√©,Meritxell,M;P√©rez-Sim√≥,Marta,M;P√©rez-Ma√≠llo,Monica,M;N√∫√±ez,Jose I,JI;Abad,Francesc X,FX;Fraile,Lorenzo,L;Pina,Sonia,S;Maj√	-0.976089

BACKGROUND : Tumor necrosis factor is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in the sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction secondary to major trauma . The purpose of this article was to research the clinical relevance of the TNF gene polymorphism in patients with major trauma . METHODS : Three hundred six patients with major trauma were prospectively recruited . The TNF gene polymorphisms were genotyped using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis . Plasma TNF-Œ± levels were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Sepsis morbidity rate and multiple organ dysfunction scores were accessed . RESULTS : The TNF-Œ ±/- 308 polymorphism was shown to be well associated with increased capacity of peripheral leukocytes to produce TNF-Œ± in response to ex vivo lipopolysaccharide stimulation in trauma patients at admission . Results from association study indicated that trauma patients carrying the TNF-Œ ±/- 308 / A allele were more likely complicated with sepsis .

ERROR 20177798: 20864610	Range in pulmonary artery systolic pressure among highly trained athletes . 	BACKGROUND : Although the physiologic range of pulmonary artery systolic pressure has been reported , data on how it is manifested in athletes are limited . The aim of the present study was to explore the full spectrum of PASP and the long-term training impact in a large population of highly trained athletes . METHODS : Six hundred fifteen consecutive athletes and 230 healthy control subjects underwent transthoracic echocardiography . PASP was estimated by measuring maximal tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity with the modified Bernoulli equation . The ratio of TRV to right ventricular outflow tract time-velocity integral was obtained as a correlate of pulmonary vascular resistance . RESULTS : Left ventricular mass index and ejection fraction did not differ significantly between the two groups of athletes . Conversely , ATSs showed an increased sum of wall thickness and relative wall thickness , whereas LV end-diastolic diameter , LV stroke volume , peak TRV , and PASP were significantly higher in ATEs . The ratio between transmitral E wave and tissue Doppler e &apos; wave was not different among the three groups . The ratio TRV / RVOTTVI was ‚â§ 0.2 in all subjects . A TRV value &gt; 2.5 m / s was observed in 76 athletes . By multivariable analysis , age , type and duration of training , and LV stroke volume were the only independent predictors of PASP in athletes . CONCLUSIONS : This study delineates the full range of resting TRV and derived PASP in highly trained athletes . The upper physiologic limit of PASP in endurance athletes may reach 40 mm Hg , in line with the greater increase in stroke volume . This should be considered a &quot; physiologic phenomenon &quot; when evaluating athletes for sports eligibility . 	2010	2010-09-25	Chest;2011 Apr;139;4;788-94;	D&apos;Andrea,Antonello,A;Naeije,Robert,R;D&apos;Alto,Michele,M;Argiento,Paola,P;Golia,Enrica,E;Cocchia,Rosangela,R;Riegler,Lucia,L;Scarafile,Raffaella,R;Limongelli,Giuseppe,G;Di Salvo,Giovanni,G;Citro,Rodolfo,R;Caso,Pio,P;Russo,Maria Giovanna,MG;Calabr√	-1.23027
ERROR 20178512: 20865364	In vitro and in vivo matrix metalloproteinase expression after photodynamic therapy with a liposomal formulation of aminolevulinic acid and its methyl ester . 	Photodynamic therapy is a well-known method for the treatment of malignant tumors , and its principles have been well established over the past 30 years . This therapy involves the application of a chemical called a photosensitizer and its subsequent excitation with light at the appropriate wavelength and energy . Topical photodynamic therapy with aminolevulinic acid is an alternative therapy for many malignant processes , including nonmelanoma skin cancers such as basal-cell carcinoma . Our novel approach for this study was to use a liposomal formulation of 5-ALA and its methyl ester both in vitro and in vivo , and to check whether the liposome-entrapped precursors of photosensitizers can induce the expression of metalloproteinases in animal tumor cells and in other tissues from tumor-bearing rats and in selected cell lines in vitro . We also checked whether the application of tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases has any effect on MMPs in the above-mentioned experimental models , and if they can cause complete inhibition of MMP expression . Immunohistochemical studies revealed that after the PDT , the intensity of expression of MMPs in healthy animals was very low and seen in single cells only . After the PDT in tumor-bearing rats , MMP-3 was expressed in the tumor cells with the highest intensity of staining in the tissues directly adjacent to the tumors , while MMP-2 and -9 were not found . In the control groups , there was no observed expression of MMPs . In vitro studies showed that MMP-3 was expressed in MCF-7 cells after PDT , but MMP-9 was not observed and MMP-2 was only seen in single cases . Our studies confirmed that the application of an MMP-3 inhibitor may block an induction of MMP-3 expression which had previously been initiated by PDT . The preliminary data obtained from cancer patients revealed that new precursors are effective in terms of PDT , and that using MMP inhibitors should be considered as a potential enhancing factor in clinical PDT . 	2010	2010-09-25	Cellular &amp; molecular biology letters;2010 Dec;15;4;630-50;	Osiecka,Beata,B;Jurczyszyn,Kamil,K;Symonowicz,Krzysztof,K;Bronowicz,Andrzej,A;Ostasiewicz,Pawe≈Ç,P;Czapi≈Ñska,Elzbieta,E;Hotowy,Katarzyna,K;Krzystek-Korpacka,Ma≈Çgorzata,M;Gebarowska,Elzbieta,E;Izykowska,Ilona,I;Dziegiel,Piotr,P;Terlecki,Grzegorz,G;Zi√≥≈	-1.52227

We have built and extensively tested a tool-chain to prepare and screen two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins by transmission electron microscopy at room temperature . This automated process is an extension of a new procedure described recently that allows membrane protein 2D crystallization in parallel . The system includes a gantry robot that transfers and prepares the crystalline solutions on grids suitable for TEM analysis and an entirely automated microscope that can analyze 96 grids at once without human interference . The operation of the system at the user level is solely controlled within the MATLAB environment : the commands to perform sample handling , microscope steering as well as automatic crystal detection have been implemented . Different types of thin samples can efficiently be screened provided that the particular detection algorithm is adapted to the specific task . Hence , operating time can be shared between multiple users .

ERROR 20186667: 20874250	Role of differential expression of interferon receptor isoforms on the response of multiple sclerosis patients to therapy with interferon beta . 	The cytokine interferon -Œ≤ is successfully used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis . However , some patients fail to respond to therapy , probably due to different biological patterns that are of importance in influencing clinical response . A common mechanism involved in the modulation of responsiveness to cytokine is represented by regulation of their receptor expression through autocrine-ligand-mediated loops . Mechanistically , IFN-Œ≤ exerts its biological effects through interaction with the IFN-Œ ±/- Œ≤-receptor , which then activates several transcription factors . IFNAR is composed of 2 chains , IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 , which associate with IFN-Œ≤ to form a ternary complex . The major ligand-binding subunit is IFNAR-2 and it exists in 3 mRNA splice variants , resulting in 2 transmembrane isoforms and a soluble one . On the contrary , from normal cells only one IFNAR-1 isoform , with transcriptional capacity , was identified . In the past decades , considerable information has accumulated pertaining to the downregulation of the IFNAR complex in IFN-treated patients , but only a few studies have investigated the molecular events involved in this phenomenon . The intent of the present review is to place this receptor downregulation in the context of IFN-Œ≤ therapy and of its clinical and biological outcomes in IFN-Œ≤-treated patients . 	2010	2010-09-30	Journal of interferon &amp; cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research;2010 Oct;30;10;733-41;	Gilli,Francesca,F;	-0.121097

ERROR 20213043: 20920932	Microneurosurgical management of anterior choroid artery aneurysms . 	OBJECTIVE : Anterior choroid artery aneurysms constitute 2 % -5 % of all intracranial aneurysms . They are usually small , thin walled with one or several arteries originating at their base , and often associated with multiple aneurysms . In this article , we review the practical microsurgical anatomy , the preoperative imaging , surgical planning , and the microneurosurgical steps in the dissection and the clipping of AChAAs . METHODS : This review , and the whole series on intracranial aneurysms , are mainly based on the personal microneurosurgical experience of the senior author in two Finnish centers that serve , without patient selection , the catchment area in Southern and Eastern Finland . RESULTS : These two centers have treated more than 10,000 patients with IAs since 1951 . In the Kuopio Cerebral Aneurysm Database of 3005 patients with 4253 IAs , 831 patients had altogether 980 internal carotid artery aneurysms , of whom 95 patients had 99 AChAAs . Ruptured AChAAs , found in 39 patients , with median size of 6 mm , were associated with intracerebral hematoma in only 1 patient . Multiple aneurysms were seen in 58 patients . CONCLUSIONS : The main difficulty in microneurosurgical management of AChAAs is to preserve flow in the anterior choroid artery originating at the base and often attached to the aneurysm dome . This necessitates perfect surgical strategy based on preoperative knowledge of 3 dimensional angioarchitecture and proper orientation during the microsurgical dissection . 	2010	2010-10-06	World neurosurgery;2010 May;73;5;486-99;	Lehecka,Martin,M;Dashti,Reza,R;Laakso,Aki,A;van Popta,Jouke S,JS;Romani,Rossana,R;Navratil,Ondrej,O;Kivipelto,Leena,L;Kivisaari,Riku,R;Foroughi,Mansoor,M;Kokuzawa,Jouji,J;Lehto,Hanna,H;Niemel√§,Mika,M;Rinne,Jaakko,J;Ronkainen,Antti,A;Koivisto,Timo,T;J√§√	-1.1945

METHODS : Complete blood cell count and hemoglobin electrophoresis analyses were performed in 125 HbCS cases . The Œ±-and Œ≤-thalassemia mutations were determined by reverse dot-blotting and Gap-PCR . RESULTS : The presence of the SEA deletion or Hb Quong Sze with HbCS leads to HbH-CS disease . There was significant difference between HbH-CS and Œ±CSŒ ±/- Œ± , HbH-CS and Œ±CSŒ± / Œ±Œ± in the hematological parameters . The genotype of Œ±CSŒ ±/- Œ± or Œ±Œ± / Œ±CSŒ± had slight effect on hematological parameters . When the Hb Constant Spring mutation co-existed with heterozygous Œ≤-thalassemia , the hematological characteristics of Œ≤-thalassemia was presented . Only 57.6 % of carriers with HbCS were detected by hemoglobin electrophoresis . CONCLUSION : The cases with co-existence of HbCS trait and other Œ±-thalassemia trait , or Œ≤-thalassemia trait , showed variation in their red blood cell parameters . For such compound heterozygotes for HbCS and other Œ±- or Œ≤-thalassaemia mutations , which were usually misdiagnosed in clinical screening by hemoglobin electrophoresis , accurate diagnose can be made by molecular diagnosis . 	2010	2010-10-12	Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics;2010 Oct;27;5;481-3;	Sun,Man-na,MN;Xiong,Fu,F;Zhang,Xin-hua,XH;Lou,Ji-wu,JW;Xu,Xiang-min,XM;	-1.14546

Fruit development is a highly complex process , which involves major changes in plant metabolism leading to cell growth and differentiation . Changes in cell wall composition and structure play a major role in modulating cell growth . We investigated the changes in cell wall composition and the activities of associated enzymes during the dry fruit development of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana . Silique development is characterized by several specific phases leading to fruit dehiscence and seed dispersal . We showed that early phases of silique growth were characterized by specific changes in non-cellulosic sugar content . Xyloglucan oligosaccharide mass profiling further showed a strong increase in O-acetylated xyloglucans over the course of silique development , which could suggest a decreased capacity of xyloglucans to be associated with each other or to cellulose . The degree of methylesterification , mediated by the activity of pectin methylesterases , decreased over the course of silique growth and dehiscence .

ERROR 20394010: 21114847	Evidence for SMAD3 as a modifier of breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers . 	INTRODUCTION : Current attempts to identify genetic modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 associated risk have focused on a candidate gene approach , based on knowledge of gene functions , or the development of large genome-wide association studies . In this study , we evaluated 24 SNPs tagged to 14 candidate genes derived through a novel approach that analysed gene expression differences to prioritise candidate modifier genes for association studies . METHODS : We successfully genotyped 24 SNPs in a cohort of up to 4,724 BRCA1 and 2,693 BRCA2 female mutation carriers from 15 study groups and assessed whether these variants were associated with risk of breast cancer in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers . RESULTS : SNPs in five of the 14 candidate genes showed evidence of association with breast cancer risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 carriers . Notably , the minor alleles of two SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium , located at the SMAD3 locus , were each associated with increased breast cancer risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers . CONCLUSIONS : This study provides evidence that the SMAD3 gene , which encodes a key regulatory protein in the transforming growth factor beta signalling pathway and is known to interact directly with BRCA2 , may contribute to increased risk of breast cancer in BRCA2 mutation carriers . This finding suggests that genes with expression associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation status are enriched for the presence of common genetic modifiers of breast cancer risk in these populations . 	2010	2010-12-01	Breast cancer research : BCR;2010;12;6;R102;	Walker,Logan C,LC;Fredericksen,Zachary S,ZS;Wang,Xianshu,X;Tarrell,Robert,R;Pankratz,Vernon S,VS;Lindor,Noralane M,NM;Beesley,Jonathan,J;Healey,Sue,S;Chen,Xiaoqing,X;Stoppa-Lyonnet,Dominique,D;Tirapo,Carole,C;Giraud,Sophie,S;Mazoyer,Sylvie,S;Muller,Dani√	-0.707154
ERROR 20394070: 21114907	Correlation of beta-thalassemia mutations with alpha-thalassemia : an experience of the southwestern region of Iran . 	BACKGROUND AND AIMS : Thalassemias are the commonest monogenic diseases worldwide . Mutations in genes coding for the globin proteins that alter protein output , produce the thalassemia syndromes . This study aimed to present the cases of alpha-thalassemia in beta-thalassemic patients from Khuzestan province in Iran . MATERIALS AND METHODS : A total of 227 subjects including thalassemia patients , and their parents and siblings from unrelated Khuzestani families were included in this study . The standard diagnostic marker for beta-thalassemia is elevation of the hemoglobin A2 level , while low mean corpuscular volume and mean cell hemoglobin with a normal HbA2 level indicate alpha-thalassemia carrier . RESULTS : The amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction confirmed that among 227 subjects , 147 were heterozygous beta-thalassemia patients and 80 were identified either normal or with unknown mutations . Out of these 147 patients , nine cases were diagnosed as compound heterozygous . The IVS11-1 mutation was found in majority of chromosomes . Out of nine beta / alpha-thalassemia patients , four showed -Œ± / Œ±Œ± , two had -Œ ±/- Œ± , one had -Œ± / Œ±Œ± and one had - -MED / Œ±Œ± genotypes . CONCLUSION : The present study suggests the need to establish a program for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis of beta-thalassemia for affected families and for initiating a control program by prospective screening of pregnant women . The application of the knowledge about mutation pattern was found to be beneficial since the mutations could be screened in the order in which they are present in our population . Hence , it will not only help to reduce the screening cost but also to promote early genetic counseling and prevention of an affected child . 	2010	2010-12-01	Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands);2010 Dec;15;6;430-3;	Rahim,Fakher,F;	-1.35433

ERROR 20404431: 21126223	AAV delivery of wild-type rhodopsin preserves retinal function in a mouse model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa . 	Autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa is frequently caused by mutations in RHO , the gene for rod photoreceptor opsin . Earlier , a study on mice carrying mutated rhodopsin transgenes on either RHO‚Äâ+‚Äâ / ‚Äâ+‚Äâ or RHO‚Äâ+‚Ä â/- backgrounds suggested that the amount of wild-type rhodopsin affected survival of photoreceptors . Therefore , we treated P23H RHO transgenic mice with adeno-associated virus serotype 5 expressing a cDNA clone of the rhodopsin gene that expressed normal opsin from the mouse opsin promoter . Analysis of the electroretinogram demonstrated that increased expression of RHO301 slowed the rate of retinal degeneration in P23H mice : at 6 months , a-wave amplitudes were increased by 100 % and b-wave amplitudes by 79 % . In contrast , nontransgenic mice injected with AAV5 RHO301 demonstrated a decrease in the ERG , confirming the damaging effect of rhodopsin overproduction in normal photoreceptors . In P23H mice , the increase in the ERG amplitudes was correlated with improvement of retinal structure : the thickness of the outer nuclear layer in RHO301-treated eyes was increased by 80 % compared with control eyes . These findings suggest that the wild-type RHO gene can be delivered to rescue retinal degeneration in mice carrying a RHO mutation and that increased production of normal rhodopsin can suppress the effect of the mutated protein . These findings make it possible to treat ADRP caused by different mutations of RHO with the expression of wild-type RHO . 	2010	2010-12-04	Human gene therapy;2011 May;22;5;567-75;	Mao,Haoyu,H;James,Thomas,T;Schwein,Alison,A;Shabashvili,Arseniy E,AE;Hauswirth,William W,WW;Gorbatyuk,Marina S,MS;Lewin,Alfred S,AS;	-1.10375
ERROR 20407967: 21129942	Blood lead and cadmium levels in a six hospital employee population . PESA study , 2009 . 	INTRODUCTION : Exposure to lead and cadmium is a public health problem due to the broad exposure to these toxic substances among the general population . The objective of this study is to determine blood lead and cadmium concentrations in a working population drawn from six university hospitals in Madrid , Getafe , Cartagena , Santiago de Compostela , Santander and Palma de Mallorca and to identify associated factors . MATERIALS AND METHODS : 951 individuals participated in the study and were administered the standardized PESA¬Æ questionnaire regarding exposure to lead and cadmium . The blood lead and cadmium concentrations were measured by electrothermal atomization atomic absorption spectrometry with Zeeman background correction in Perkin-Elmer spectrometers , guaranteeing the transferability of the results . RESULTS : The median overall blood lead concentration was : 1.6 Œºg / dL and that of cadmium was : 0.21 Œºg / L . There were significant differences in lead levels between men and women , postmenopausal and premenopausal women , and between participants who cooked in earthenware and those who did not . The median of cadmium in women was higher than in men and was also higher in subjects who smoked than in non-smokers . CONCLUSIONS : A reduction in blood lead and cadmium levels was observed with respect to previous studies carried out in Spain . Nevertheless , the results suggest there are certain factors which increase risk such as age , gender , menopause , age of housing , cooking in lead-glazed earthenware and exposure to cigarette smoke . 	2010	2010-12-07	Journal of trace elements in medicine and biology : organ of the Society for Minerals and Trace Elements (GMS);2011 Jan;25 Suppl 1;;S22-9;	Gonz√°lez-Estecha,Montserrat,M;Trasobares,Elena,E;Fuentes,Manuel,M;Mart√≠nez,Mar√≠a Jos√©,MJ;Cano,Sara,S;Vergara,Nuria,N;Gaspar,Mar√≠a Jes√∫s,MJ;Gonz√°lez-Revalder√≠a,Joaqu√≠n,J;Barciela,Mar√≠a Carmen,MC;Bugar√≠n,Zoila,Z;Fern√°ndez,Mar√≠a Dolores,MD;Bad√	-1.32507

Th1 cytokine-induced loss of oligodendrocytes is associated with axonal loss in CNS demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis that contributes to neurological disabilities in affected individuals . Recent studies indicated that , in addition to Th1-phenotype cytokines including tumor necrosis factor -Œ± , Th17 phenotype cytokine , interleukin -17 also involved in the development of MS . In this study , we investigated the direct effect of IL-17 on the survival of OLs in the presence of TNF-Œ± and individually in vitro settings . Our findings suggest that IL-17 alone , however , was not able to affect the survival of OLs , but it exacerbates the TNF-Œ±-induced OL apoptosis as compared with individual TNF-Œ± treatment . This effect of cytokines was ascribed to an inhibition of cell-survival mechanisms , co-localization of Bid / Bax proteins in the mitochondrial membrane and caspase 8 activation mediated release of apoptosis inducing factor from mitochondria in treated OLs . In addition , cytokine treatment disturbed the mitochondrial membrane potential in OLs with corresponding increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species , which were attenuated by N-acetyl cysteine treatment . In addition , combining of these cytokines induced cell-cycle arrest at G1 / S phases in OL-like cells and inhibited the maturation of OL progenitor cells that was attenuated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Œ ≥/- Œ≤ agonists . Collectively , these data provide initial evidence that IL-17 exacerbates TNF-Œ±-induced OL loss and inhibits the differentiation of OL progenitor cells suggesting that antioxidant- or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist-based therapies have potential to limit CNS demyelination in MS or other related demyelinating disorders . 	2010	2010-12-15	Journal of neurochemistry;2011 Feb;116;4;508-21;	Paintlia,Manjeet K,MK;Paintlia,Ajaib S,AS;Singh,Avtar K,AK;Singh,Inderjit,I;	-1.10764

Shell structure and magic numbers in atomic nuclei were generally explained by pioneering work that introduced a strong spin-orbit interaction to the nuclear shell model potential . However , knowledge of nuclear forces and the mechanisms governing the structure of nuclei , in particular far from stability , is still incomplete . In nuclei with equal neutron and proton numbers , enhanced correlations arise between neutrons and protons that occupy orbitals with the same quantum numbers . Such correlations have been predicted to favour an unusual type of nuclear superfluidity , termed isoscalar neutron-proton pairing , in addition to normal isovector pairing . Despite many experimental efforts , these predictions have not been confirmed . Here we report the experimental observation of excited states in the N = Z = 46 nucleus Pd . Gamma rays emitted following the NiPd fusion-evaporation reaction were identified using a combination of state-of-the-art high-resolution Œ≥-ray , charged-particle and neutron detector systems . Our results reveal evidence for a spin-aligned , isoscalar neutron-proton coupling scheme , different from the previous prediction . We suggest that this coupling scheme replaces normal superfluidity in the ground and low-lying excited states of the heaviest N = Z nuclei . Such strong , isoscalar neutron-proton correlations would have a considerable impact on the nuclear level structure and possibly influence the dynamics of rapid proton capture in stellar nucleosynthesis . 	2010	2010-12-24	Nature;2011 Jan 6;469;7328;68-71;	Cederwall,B,B;Moradi,F Ghazi,FG;B√§ck,T,T;Johnson,A,A;Blomqvist,J,J;Cl√©ment,E,E;de France,G,G;Wadsworth,R,R;Andgren,K,K;Lagergren,K,K;Dijon,A,A;Jaworski,G,G;Liotta,R,R;Qi,C,C;Nyak√≥,B M,BM;Nyberg,J,J;Palacz,M,M;Al-Azri,H,H;Algora,A,A;de Angelis,G,G;Ata√	-1.1317

The clinical course of FL patients is variable , whereby a subset of patients survive for long periods even without relapses , whereas the majority have frequent relapses with shorter survival . We have analyzed a series of 186 FLs , studying the correlation between clinical outcome and the tumor cell expression of a set of immunohistochemical markers , using an automated procedure for tissue microarrays to reduce the subjectivity of scoring . The results identified several markers associated with differences in overall survival in univariate analyses , such as Cyclin E , Mdm2 , CD10 , p21 , IgD , Bcl-xL , CD30 , and E2F6 . Cases with a higher level of expression of Cyclin E , Mdm2 , p21 , IgD , Bcl-xL , CD30 , and E2F6 were associated with a significantly shorter OS . On the other hand , strong CD10 expression was linked to a significantly better outcome . A Cox model was then constructed , integrating the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score and a restricted selection of three immunohistochemical markers : Cyclin E , Mdm2 , and CD10 expression . A potentially useful finding is that the integrated FLIPI plus immunohistochemical model can be used to identify a subset of 26 patients , with a survival probability of 100 % at 5 years .

The examples herein present evidence of the deeply controversial situations faced by both individuals at risk and professionals in charge of these predictive studies , suggesting a need for expanded guidelines to address such complexities . 	2011	2011-01-26	Journal of genetic counseling;2011 Jun;20;3;241-8;	Mari√±o,Tania Cruz,TC;Armi√±√°n,Rub√©n Reynaldo,RR;Cede√±o,Humberto Jorge,HJ;Mesa,Jos√© Miguel Laffita,JM;Zaldivar,Yanetza Gonz√°lez,YG;Rodr√≠guez,Ra√∫l Aguilera,RA;Santos,Miguel Vel√°zquez,MV;Mederos,Luis Enrique Almaguer,LE;Herrera,Milena Paneque,MP;P√	-0.823732
ERROR 20555321: 21287665	Long-term outcome of treatment with infliximab in pediatric-onset Crohn &apos; s disease : a population-based study . 	BACKGROUND : We examined short- and long-term benefits and safety of infliximab in a population-based cohort of Crohn &apos; s disease patients &lt; 17 years old at diagnosis . METHODS : The following parameters were assessed : short- and long-term efficacy of IFX , impact of drug efficacy , and mode of administration on rate of resection surgery , growth and nutritional catch-up , and adverse events . RESULTS : In all , 120 patients required IFX with a median duration of 32 months . Median age at diagnosis was 14.5 years and median interval between diagnosis and IFX initiation was 41 months . Median follow-up since CD diagnosis was 111 months . Fifty patients received episodic and 70 maintenance therapy . Sixty-five patients were in the &quot; IFX efficacy &quot; group : 38 still receiving IFX at the last visit and 27 stopping IFX while in remission . The &quot; IFX failure &quot; group included 55 patients : 17 who stopped IFX due to AEs and 38 nonresponders . The risk of surgery was reduced in the &quot; IFX efficacy &quot; group and lower in patients with scheduled versus episodic therapy . Patients in the &quot; IFX efficacy &quot; group had significant catch-up growth , while those in the &quot; IFX failure &quot; group did not . Twenty-four patients presented AEs leading to cessation of IFX in 17 of them . CONCLUSIONS : In this population-based cohort of pediatric-onset CD , IFX treatment was effective in more than half of patients during a median follow-up of 32 months . Long-term IFX responders had a lower rate of surgery and improved catch-up in growth , especially when receiving scheduled IFX therapy . 	2011	2011-02-03	Inflammatory bowel diseases;2011 Oct;17;10;2144-52;	Cromb√©,Val√©rie,V;Salleron,Julia,J;Savoye,Guillaume,G;Dupas,Jean-Louis,JL;Vernier-Massouille,Gw√©nola,G;Lerebours,Eric,E;Cortot,Antoine,A;Merle,V√©ronique,V;Vasseur,Francis,F;Turck,Dominique,D;Gower-Rousseau,Corinne,C;L√©mann,Marc,M;Colombel,Jean-Fr√©d√	-1.34121
ERROR 20560572: 21293104	Occurrence of cleft-palate and alteration of Tgf-Œ≤ expression and the mechanisms leading to palatal fusion in mice following dietary folic-acid deficiency . 	Folic acid is essential for numerous bodily functions . Its decrease during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations in the progeny . The relationship between FA deficiency and the appearance of cleft palate is controversial , and little information exists on a possible effect of FA on palate development . We investigated the effect of a 2-8 weeks &apos; induced FA deficiency in female mice on the development of CP in their progeny as well as the mechanisms leading to palatal fusion , i.e. cell proliferation , cell death , and palatal-shelf adhesion and fusion . We showed that an 8 weeks &apos; maternal FA deficiency caused complete CP in the fetuses although a 2 weeks &apos; maternal FA deficiency was enough to alter all the mechanisms analyzed . Since transforming growth factor-Œ≤ is crucial for palatal fusion and since most of the mechanisms impaired by FA deficiency were also observed in the palates of Tgf-Œ≤null mutant mice , we investigated the presence of TGF-Œ≤ mRNA , its protein and phospho-SMAD2 in FA-deficient mouse palates . Our results evidenced a large reduction in Tgf-Œ≤ expression in palates of embryos of dams fed an FAD diet for 8 weeks ; Tgf-Œ≤ expression was less reduced in palates of embryos of dams fed an FAD diet for 2 weeks . Addition of TGF-Œ≤ to palatal-shelf cultures of embryos of dams fed an FAD diet for 2 weeks normalized all the altered mechanisms . Thus , an insufficient folate status may be a risk factor for the development of CP in mice , and exogenous TGF-Œ≤ compensates this deficit in vitro . 	2011	2011-02-05	Cells, tissues, organs;2011;194;5;406-20;	Maldonado,Estela,E;Murillo,Jorge,J;Barrio,Carmen,C;del R√≠o,Aurora,A;P√©rez-Miguelsanz,Juliana,J;L√≥pez-Gordillo,Yamila,Y;Partearroyo,Teresa,T;Paradas,Irene,I;Maestro,Carmen,C;Mart√≠nez-Sanz,Elena,E;Varela-Moreiras,Gregorio,G;Mart√≠nez-√Ålvarez,Concepci√	-1.11264
ERROR 20562225: 21294882	Supporting work practices through telehealth : impact on nurses in peripheral regions . 	BACKGROUND : In Canada , workforce shortages in the health care sector constrain the ability of the health care system to meet the needs of its population and of its health care professionals . This issue is of particular importance in peripheral regions of Quebec , where significant inequalities in workforce distribution between regions has lead to acute nursing shortages and increased workloads . Information and communication technologies are innovative solutions that can be used to develop strategies to optimise the use of available resources and to design new nursing work practices . However , current knowledge is still limited about the real impact of ICTs on nursing recruitment and retention . Our aim is to better understand how work practice reorganization , supported by ICTs , and particularly by telehealth , may influence professional , educational , and organizational factors relating to Quebec nurses , notably those working in peripheral regions . METHODS / DESIGN : First , we will conduct a descriptive study on the issue of nursing recruitment . Stratified sampling will be used to select approximately twenty innovative projects relating to the reorganization of work practices based upon ICTs . Semi-structured interviews with key informants will determine professional , educational , and organizational recruitment factors . The results will be used to create a questionnaire which , using a convenience sampling method , will be mailed to 600 third year students and recent graduates of two Quebec university nursing faculties . Descriptive , correlation , and hierarchical regression analyses will be performed to identify factors influencing nursing graduates &apos; intentions to practice in peripheral regions . Secondly , we will conduct five case studies pertaining to the issue of nursing retention . Five ICT projects in semi-urban , rural , and isolated regions have been identified . Qualitative data will be collected through field observation and approximately fifty semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders . DISCUSSION : Data from both parts of this research project will be jointly analysed using triangulation of researchers , theoretical approaches , methods , and results . Continuous exchanges with decision makers and periodic knowledge transfer activities are planned to facilitate the dissemination and utilization of research results in policies regarding the nursing recruitment and retention . 	2011	2011-02-08	BMC health services research;2011;11;;27;	Gagnon,Marie-Pierre,MP;Par√©,Guy,G;Pollender,Hugo,H;Duplantie,Julie,J;C√¥t√©,Jos√©,J;Fortin,Jean-Paul,JP;Labadie,Rita,R;Dupl√†a,Emmanuel,E;Thifault,Marie-Claude,MC;Courcy,Fran√ßois,F;McGinn,Carrie Anna,CA;Ly,Birama Apho,BA;Tr√©panier,Am√©lie,A;Malo,Fran√	-1.92568
ERROR 20609230: 21344212	Optimized assay and storage conditions for enzyme activity profiling of ectomycorrhizae . 	The aim of a joint effort by different research teams was to provide an improved procedure for enzyme activity profiling of field-sampled ectomycorrhizae , including recommendations on the best conditions and maximum duration for storage of ectomycorrhizal samples . A more simplified and efficient protocol compared to formerly published procedures was achieved by using manufactured 96-filter plates in combination with a vacuum manifold and by optimizing incubation times . Major improvements were achieved by performing the series of eight enzyme assays with a single series of root samples instead of two series , reducing the time needed for sample preparation , minimizing error-prone steps such as pipetting and morphotyping , and facilitating subsequent DNA analyses due to the reduced sequencing effort . The best preservation of samples proved to be storage in soil at 4-6 ¬∞C in the form of undisturbed soil cores containing roots . Enzyme activities were maintained for up to 4 weeks under these conditions . Short-term storage of washed roots and ectomycorrhizal tips overnight in water did not cause substantial changes in enzyme activity profiles . No optimal means for longer-term storage by freezing at -20 ¬∞C or storage in 100 % ethanol were recommended . 	2011	2011-02-24	Mycorrhiza;2011 Oct;21;7;589-600;	Pritsch,Karin,K;Courty,Pierre Emanuel,PE;Churin,Jean-Louis,JL;Cloutier-Hurteau,Benoit,B;Ali,Muhammad Arif,MA;Damon,Coralie,C;Duchemin,Myriam,M;Egli,Simon,S;Ernst,Jana,J;Fraissinet-Tachet,Laurence,L;Kuhar,Francisco,F;Legname,Elvira,E;Marmeisse,Roland,R;M√	-1.29689
ERROR 20630510: 21368142	Molecular basis of substrate-induced permeation by an amino acid antiporter . 	Transporters of the amino acid , polyamine and organocation superfamily play essential roles in cell redox balance , cancer , and aminoacidurias . The bacterial L-arginine / agmatine antiporter , AdiC , is the main APC structural paradigm and shares the &quot; 5 + 5 inverted repeat &quot; fold found in other families like the Na-coupled neurotransmitter transporters . The available AdiC crystal structures capture two states of its transport cycle : the open-to-out apo and the outward-facing Arg-bound occluded . However , the role of Arg during the transition between these two states remains unknown . Here , we report the crystal structure at 3.0 ‚Ñ´ resolution of an Arg-bound AdiC mutant in the open-to-out conformation , completing the picture of the major conformational states during the transport cycle of the 5 + 5 inverted repeat fold-transporters . The N101A structure is an intermediate state between the previous known AdiC conformations . The Arg-guanidinium group in the current structure presents high mobility and delocalization , hampering substrate occlusion and resulting in a low translocation rate . Further analysis supports that proper coordination of this group with residues Asn101 and Trp293 is required to transit to the occluded state , providing the first clues on the molecular mechanism of substrate-induced fit in a 5 + 5 inverted repeat fold-transporter . The pseudosymmetry found between repeats in AdiC , and in all fold-related transporters , restraints the conformational changes , in particular the transmembrane helices rearrangements , which occur during the transport cycle . In AdiC these movements take place away from the dimer interface , explaining the independent functioning of each subunit . 	2011	2011-03-04	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America;2011 Mar 8;108;10;3935-40;	Kowalczyk,Lukasz,L;Ratera,Merc√®,M;Paladino,Antonella,A;Bartoccioni,Paola,P;Errasti-Murugarren,Ekaitz,E;Valencia,Eva,E;Portella,Guillem,G;Bial,Susanna,S;Zorzano,Antonio,A;Fita,Ignacio,I;Orozco,Modesto,M;Carpena,Xavier,X;V√°zquez-Ibar,Jos√© Luis,JL;Palac√	-0.381613
ERROR 20655655: 21394207	Inhibitory effect of TNF-Œ± on malaria pre-erythrocytic stage development : influence of host hepatocyte / parasite combinations . 	BACKGROUND : The liver stages of malaria parasites are inhibited by cytokines such as interferon-Œ≥ or Interleukin -6 . Binding of these cytokines to their receptors at the surface of the infected hepatocytes leads to the production of nitric oxide and radical oxygen intermediates , which kill hepatic parasites . However , conflicting results were obtained with TNF-Œ± possibly because of differences in the models used . We have reassessed the role of TNF-Œ± in the different cellular systems used to study the Plasmodium pre-erythrocytic stages . METHODS AND FINDINGS : Human or mouse TNF-Œ± were tested against human and rodent malaria parasites grown in vitro in human or rodent primary hepatocytes , or in hepatoma cell lines . Our data demonstrated that TNF-Œ± treatment prevents the development of malaria pre-erythrocytic stages . This inhibitory effect however varies with the infecting parasite species and with the nature and origin of the cytokine and hepatocytes . Inhibition was only observed for all parasite species tested when hepatocytes were pre-incubated 24 or 48 hrs before infection and activity was directed only against early hepatic parasite . We further showed that TNF-Œ± inhibition was mediated by a soluble factor present in the supernatant of TNF-Œ± stimulated hepatocytes but it was not related to NO or ROI . Treatment TNF-Œ± prevents the development of human and rodent malaria pre-erythrocytic stages through the activity of a mediator that remains to be identified . CONCLUSIONS : Treatment TNF-Œ± prevents the development of human and rodent malaria pre-erythrocytic stages through the activity of a mediator that remains to be identified . However , the nature of the cytokine-host cell-parasite combination must be carefully considered for extrapolation to the human infection . 	2011	2011-03-12	PloS one;2011;6;3;e17464;	Depinay,Nadya,N;Franetich,Jean Francois,JF;Gr√ºner,Anne Charlotte,AC;Mauduit,Marjorie,M;Chavatte,Jean-Marc,JM;Luty,Adrian J F,AJ;van Gemert,Geert-Jan,GJ;Sauerwein,Robert W,RW;Siksik,Jean-Michel,JM;Hannoun,Laurent,L;Mazier,Dominique,D;Snounou,Georges,G;R√	-0.908205

OBJECTIVE : To compare the epidemiology , clinical variables , outcome and molecular characteristics between methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus bloodstream infections of patients from a tertiary-care center . METHODS : We conducted a five-year retrospective cohort analysis of all patients with at least one peripherally-drawn blood culture positive for S. aureus . Patient characteristics , clinical data and outcome were analyzed , as well as microbiologic data . RESULTS : We included 444 isolates derived from 172 patients . The highest rate of MRSA BSI was observed in 2005 . MRSA BSIs were more likely to be originated from a skin and soft tissue infection . The only significant risk factor for MRSA BSI was the mean length of hospital stay . A difference in inadequate initial treatment was noticed in MRSA BSI ; but it had no impact on mortality . All MRSA isolates were SCCmec type II , and we did not find any resistance to vancomycin or linezolid . CONCLUSION : MRSA BSIs were associated with a prolonged hospital stay . We did not observe any difference in mortality between MRSA and MSSA BSIs . During the study period , we only identified SCCmec type II in MRSA isolates , which suggests that this infection was hospital- acquired . 	2011	2011-03-22	Revista de investigaci√≥n cl√≠nica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutrici√≥n;2010 Nov-Dec;62;6;553-9;	Ponce-de-Le√≥n,Alfredo,A;Camacho-Ortiz,Adri√°n,A;Mac√≠as,Alejandro E,AE;Land√≠n-Larios,Carolina,C;Villanueva-Walbey,Constanza,C;Trinidad-Guerrero,Dayanira,D;L√≥pez-J√°come,Esa√∫,E;Galindo-Fraga,Arturo,A;Bobadilla-del-Valle,Miriam,M;Sifuentes-Osornio,Jos√	-1.36762
ERROR 20682347: 21422323	Rituximab for patients with refractory mucous membrane pemphigoid . 	BACKGROUND : Mucous membrane pemphigoid still represents a potentially life- and sight-threatening disease . In a subset of patients with severe MMP , conventional immunosuppressants are ineffective or contraindicated . OBSERVATIONS : Twenty-five patients with severe refractory MMP , including 5 with mucous membrane-dominant epidermolysis bullosa acquisita , received 1 or 2 cycles of rituximab . Twenty-one of the patients were receiving concomitant therapy with dapsone and/or sulfasalazine therapy , which was maintained during rituximab cycles . Complete responses in all affected sites were obtained in 17 patients by a median time of 12 weeks after the first cycle , and 5 additional patients responded completely after a second cycle , yielding an 88 % complete response rate . In all but 1 of the 10 patients with ocular lesions , their eyes became noninflammatory within a mean of 10 weeks . Among the 3 patients who developed severe infectious complications , 2 died ; they had been receiving concomitant conventional immunosuppressants and high-dose corticosteroids and were hypogammaglobulinemic . Treatment with immunosuppressants was discontinued for all other patients , and no other infection was observed . Ten patients experienced relapse after a mean of 4 months after achieving complete responses . CONCLUSIONS : Rituximab appears to have rapid and dramatic efficacy in patients with severe , refractory MMP . The occurrence of severe infections in patients receiving concomitant conventional immunosuppressants supports using rituximab without other immunosuppressants .

INTRODUCTION : Coitus in snakes may last up to 28 hours ; however , the mechanisms involved are unknown . AIM : To evaluate the relevance of the nitric oxide -cyclic guanosine monophosphate -phosphodiesterase type 5 system in snake corpus cavernosum reactivity . METHODS : Hemipenes were removed from anesthetized South American rattlesnakes and studied by light and scanning electronic microscopy . Isolated Crotalus corpora cavernosa were dissected from the non-spiny region of the hemipenises , and tissue reactivity was assessed in organ baths . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Cumulative concentration-response curves were constructed for acetylcholine , sodium nitroprusside , 5-cyclopropyl-2- pyrimidin-4-ylamine , and tadalafil in CCC precontracted with phenylephrine . Relaxation induced by electrical field stimulation was also done in the absence and presence of N nitro-L-arginine methyl ester , 1H- oxadiazolo quinoxalin-1-one and tetrodotoxin . RESULTS : The hemipenes consisted of two functionally concentric corpora cavernosa , one of them containing radiating bundles of smooth muscle fibers . Endothelial and neural nitric oxide synthases were present in the endothelium and neural structures , respectively ; whereas soluble guanylate cyclase and PDE5 were expressed in trabecular smooth muscle . ACh and SNP relaxed isolated CCC , with the relaxations being markedly reduced by L-NAME and ODQ , respectively . BAY 41-2272 and tadalafil caused sustained relaxations with potency values of 5.84 ¬± 0.17 and 5.10 ¬± 0.08 , respectively . In precontracted CCC , EFS caused frequency-dependent relaxations that lasted three times longer than those in mammalian CC . Although these relaxations were almost abolished by either L-NAME or ODQ , they were unaffected by TTX . In contrast , EFS-induced relaxations in marmoset CC were abolished by TTX . CONCLUSIONS : Rattlesnake CC relaxation is mediated by the NO-cGMP-PDE5 pathway in a manner similar to mammals . The novel TTX-resistant Na channel identified here may be responsible for the slow response of smooth muscle following nerve stimulation and could explain the extraordinary duration of snake coitus . 	2011	2011-04-12	The journal of sexual medicine;2011 Jun;8;6;1616-25;	Capel,Rodrigo O,RO;M√≥nica,Fab√≠ola Z,FZ;Porto,Marcovan,M;Barillas,Samuel,S;Muscar√°,Marcelo Nicol√°s,MN;Teixeira,Simone Aparecida,SA;Arruda,Andr√© Moreira Martins,AM;Pissinatti,Lorenzo,L;Pissinatti,Alcides,A;Schenka,Andr√© A,AA;Antunes,Edson,E;Nahoum,C√	-1.16918
ERROR 20735312: 21478439	Periodic fever , aphthous stomatitis , pharyngitis , and adenitis is a disorder of innate immunity and Th1 activation responsive to IL-1 blockade . 	The syndrome of periodic fever , aphthous stomatitis , pharyngitis , and cervical adenitis is the most common periodic fever disease in children . However , the pathogenesis is unknown . Using a systems biology approach we analyzed blood samples from PFAPA patients whose genetic testing excluded hereditary periodic fevers , and from healthy children and pediatric HPF patients . Gene expression profiling could clearly distinguish PFAPA flares from asymptomatic intervals , HPF flares , and healthy controls . During PFAPA attacks , complement , IL-1-related , and IFN-induced genes were significantly overexpressed , but T cell-associated transcripts were down-regulated . On the protein level , PFAPA flares were accompanied by significantly increased serum levels of chemokines for activated T lymphocytes , G-CSF , and proinflammatory cytokines . PFAPA flares also manifested a relative lymphopenia . Activated CD4 / CD25 T-lymphocyte counts correlated negatively with serum concentrations of IP-10 / CXCL10 , whereas CD4 / HLA-DR T lymphocyte counts correlated positively with serum concentrations of the counterregulatory IL-1 receptor antagonist . Based on the evidence for IL-1Œ≤ activation in PFAPA flares , we treated five PFAPA patients with a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist . All patients showed a prompt clinical and IP-10 / CXCL10 response . Our data suggest an environmentally triggered activation of complement and IL-1Œ ≤/- 18 during PFAPA flares , with induction of Th1-chemokines and subsequent retention of activated T cells in peripheral tissues . IL-1 inhibition may thus be beneficial for treatment of PFAPA attacks , with IP-10 / CXCL10 serving as a potential biomarker . 	2011	2011-04-12	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America;2011 Apr 26;108;17;7148-53;	Stojanov,Silvia,S;Lapidus,Sivia,S;Chitkara,Puja,P;Feder,Henry,H;Salazar,Juan C,JC;Fleisher,Thomas A,TA;Brown,Margaret R,MR;Edwards,Kathryn M,KM;Ward,Michael M,MM;Colbert,Robert A,RA;Sun,Hong-Wei,HW;Wood,Geryl M,GM;Barham,Beverly K,BK;Jones,Anne,A;Aksenti	-1.17651
ERROR 20739464: 21482821	Daxx-beta and Daxx-gamma , two novel splice variants of the transcriptional co-repressor Daxx . 	Daxx is involved in transcriptional control and apoptosis . It comprises several domains , including a regulatory C terminus that is responsible for the interaction with numerous proteins such as p53 , promyelocytic leukemia protein , and Hsp27 . Here , we describe the identification and characterization of two novel variants of Daxx termed Daxx-Œ≤ and Daxx-Œ≥ , which are generated by alternative splicing . Alternative splicing results in a truncated regulatory C terminus in both proteins . As a consequence , Daxx-Œ≤ and Daxx-Œ≥ show a markedly decreased affinity to PML , which in turn is associated with a different subnuclear localization of these proteins compared with Daxx . Although Daxx is localized mainly in PML-oncogenic domains Daxx-Œ≤ and Daxx-Œ≥ display a distinct distribution pattern . Furthermore , Daxx-Œ≤ and Daxx-Œ≥ show a decreased affinity to p53 also due to the truncated C terminus . We provide evidence that the p53 recruitment into PODs is Daxx isoform-dependent . The decreased affinity of Daxx-Œ ≤/- Œ≥ to p53 and PML results in a diffuse localization of p53 throughout the nucleus . In contrast to Daxx , Daxx-Œ≤ and Daxx-Œ≥ are unable to repress p53-mediated transcription . Therefore , alternative splicing of Daxx might indicate an additional level in the cellular apoptosis network . 	2011	2011-04-13	The Journal of biological chemistry;2011 Jun 3;286;22;19576-88;	Wethkamp,Nils,N;Hanenberg,Helmut,H;Funke,Sarah,S;Suschek,Christoph V,CV;Wetzel,Wiebke,W;Heikaus,Sebastian,S;Grinstein,Edgar,E;Ramp,Uwe,U;Engers,Rainer,R;Gabbert,Helmut E,HE;Mahotka,Csaba,C;	0.581912
ERROR 20746000: 21489671	Experimental Swine lung autotransplant model to study lung ischemia-reperfusion injury . 	INTRODUCTION : Ischemia-reperfusion lung injury has been investigated extensively on clinical and experimental models of cold ischemia . However , relatively few studies examine the detailed biochemical changes occurring during normothermic IR . The objective of this work was to establish an experimental lung autotransplant model to be carried out on pigs in order to study the early stages of normothermic lung IR . ANIMALS Y METHODS : Six Large-White pigs underwent a lung autotransplant which entailed left pneumonectomy , ex situ cranial lobectomy , caudal lobe reimplantation and its reperfusion for 30¬†min . Throughout the procedure , several parameters were measured in order to identify hemodynamic , gasometric and biochemical changes . Non-parametric statistical analyses were used to compare differences between periods . RESULTS : After ischemia , a significant increase in lipid peroxidation metabolites , proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines , neutrophil activation , inducible nitric oxide synthase activity and protein-kinase MAPK p38 levels were observed in lung tissue . However , constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity in lung tissue and carbon monoxide plasma levels were decrease . The same held true throughout the reperfusion period , when an increase in the constitutive heme-oxygenase activity was also shown . CONCLUSIONS : An experimental model of normothermic lung IR injury is presented and detailed changes in hemodynamic , gasometric and biochemical parameters are shown . Both the model and the studied parameters may be clinically useful in future investigations testing new therapies to prevent normothermic IR induced lung injury . 	2011	2011-04-15	Archivos de bronconeumolog√≠a;2011 Jun;47;6;283-9;	Sim√≥n Adiego,Carlos,C;Gonz√°lez-Casaurr√°n,Guillermo,G;Azc√°rate Perea,Leire,L;Isea Vi√±a,Jes√∫s,J;Vara Ameigeiras,Elena,E;Garc√≠a Mart√≠n,Cruz,C;Garutti Mart√≠nez,Ignacio,I;Casanova Barea,Javier,J;Gir√°ldez L√≥pez,Ana,A;Mart√≠n Pi√±eiro,Beatriz,B;Gonz√	-1.26526

The Ets-related gene is an Ets-transcription factor required for normal blood stem cell development . ERG expression is down-regulated during early T-lymphopoiesis but maintained in T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia , where it is recognized as an independent risk factor for adverse outcome . However , it is unclear whether ERG is directly involved in the pathogenesis of T-ALL and how its expression is regulated . Here we demonstrate that transgenic expression of ERG causes T-ALL in mice and that its knockdown reduces the proliferation of human MOLT4 T-ALL cells . We further demonstrate that ERG expression in primary human T-ALL cells is mediated by the binding of other T-cell oncogenes SCL / TAL1 , LMO2 , and LYL1 in concert with ERG , FLI1 , and GATA3 to the ERG +85 enhancer . This enhancer is not active in normal T cells but in transgenic mice targets expression to fetal liver c-kit cells , adult bone marrow stem / progenitors and early CD4CD8 double-negative thymic progenitors . Taken together , these data illustrate that ERG promotes T-ALL and that failure to extinguish activity of stem cell enhancers associated with regulatory transcription factors such as ERG can contribute to the development of leukemia . 	2011	2011-05-04	Blood;2011 Jun 30;117;26;7079-89;	Thoms,Julie A I,JA;Birger,Yehudit,Y;Foster,Sam,S;Knezevic,Kathy,K;Kirschenbaum,Yael,Y;Chandrakanthan,Vashe,V;Jonquieres,Georg,G;Spensberger,Dominik,D;Wong,Jason W,JW;Oram,S Helen,SH;Kinston,Sarah J,SJ;Groner,Yoram,Y;Lock,Richard,R;MacKenzie,Karen L,KL;G√	-0.147821

ERROR 20829780: 21577280	Protection of the vascular endothelium in experimental situations . 	One of the factors proposed as mediators of vascular dysfunction observed in diabetes is the increased generation of reactive oxygen species . This provides support for the use of antioxidants as early and appropriate pharmacological intervention in the development of late diabetic complications . In streptozotocin -induced diabetes in rats we observed endothelial dysfuction manifested by reduced endothelium-dependent response to acetylcholine of the superior mesenteric artery and aorta , as well as by increased endothelaemia . Changes in endothelium-dependent relaxation of SMA were induced by injury of the nitric oxide radical -signalling pathway since the endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor -component of relaxation was not impaired by diabetes . The endothelial dysfunction was accompanied by decreased ¬∑NO bioavailabity as a consequence of reduced activity of eNOS rather than its reduced expression . The results obtained using the chemiluminiscence method argue for increased oxidative stress and increased ROS production . The enzyme NADH-oxidase problably participates in ROS production in the later phases of diabetes . Oxidative stress was also connected with decreased levels of reduced glutathione in the early phase of diabetes . After 10 weeks of diabetes , adaptational mechanisms probably took place because GSH levels were not changed compared to controls . Antioxidant properties of SMe1EC2 found in vitro were partly confirmed in vivo . Administration of SMe1EC2 protected endothelial function . It significantly decreased endothelaemia of diabetic rats and improved endothelium-dependent relaxation of arteries , slightly decreased ROS-production and increased bioavailability of ¬∑NO in the aorta . Further studies with higher doses of SMe1EC2 may clarify the mechanism of its endothelium-protective effect in vivo . 	2011	2011-05-18	Interdisciplinary toxicology;2011 Mar;4;1;20-6;	Sotn√≠kov√°,Ru≈æena,R;Nedelƒçevov√°,Jana,J;Navarov√°,Jana,J;Nos√°ƒ∫ov√°,Viera,V;Dr√°bikov√°,Katar√≠na,K;Sz√∂cs,Katalin,K;K≈ôenek,Peter,P;Kyseƒ∫ov√°,Zuzana,Z;Bezek,Stefan,S;Knezl,Vladim√≠r,V;D≈ô√≠mal,J√°n,J;Broskov√°,Zuzana,Z;Kristov√°,Viera,V;Okruhlicov√	-1.33258

Here we analyzed the genomic distribution of CTCF in various human , mouse and chicken cell types , demonstrating the existence of evolutionarily conserved CTCF-bound sites beyond mammals .

ERROR 20855658: 21603776	Vascular alterations in high-fat diet-obese rats : role of endothelial L-arginine / NO pathway . 	BACKGROUND : Mechanisms underlying vascular abnormalities in obesity remain to be completely clarified . OBJECTIVE : L-arginine / nitric oxide pathway was evaluated on vascular response of high-fat diet-obese rats , focusing on endothelial and smooth muscle cells . METHODS : 30-day-old rats were divided in two groups : control and obese . After 30 weeks , body weight , adiposity index , blood pressure , and metabolic and endocrine profiles of the animals were recorded . Curves to noradrenaline were obtained in absence and presence of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor on intact and denuded thoracic aorta from C and OB rats . RESULTS : Body weight , adiposity index , leptin and insulin levels were increased in OB , while blood pressure was unchanged . Obesity also produced glucose tolerance and insulin resistance . Reactivity to noradrenaline of intact aorta was similar in C and OB rats . L-NAME presence produced a similar increase in maximal responses , but a higher leftward shift of noradrenaline responses in intact aorta from C than in OB rats . None of the protocols altered the reactivity to noradrenaline of denuded aortas . CONCLUSION : High-fat diet-induced obesity promotes metabolic and vascular alterations . The vascular alteration involved an endothelial L-arginine / NO pathway improvement was probably correlated to diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia . The greater resistance to L-NAME effects in aorta of obese rats raises concerns about the lower cardiovascular vulnerability of obese individuals in the presence of associated pathologies that impair NO-system activity . 	2011	2011-05-24	Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia;2011 Jul;97;1;40-5;	Nascimento,Thiago Bruder,TB;Baptista,Rafaela de F√°tima Ferreira,Rde F;Pereira,Priscila Cristina,PC;Campos,Dijon Henrique Salom√©,DH;Leopoldo,Andr√© Soares,AS;Leopoldo,Ana Paula Lima,AP;Oliveira J√∫nior,Silvio A,SA;Padovani,Carlos Roberto,CR;Cicogna,Ant√	-1.30988

OBJECTIVE : It has been suggested that interleukin -6 is one of the mediators linking obesity-derived chronic inflammation with insulin resistance through activation of STAT3 , with subsequent upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 . We evaluated whether peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor -Œ ≤/- Œ¥ prevented activation of the IL-6-STAT3-SOCS3 pathway and insulin resistance in adipocytes . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Adipocytes and white adipose tissue from wild-type and PPAR-Œ ≤/- Œ¥-null mice were used to evaluate the effect of PPAR-Œ ≤/- Œ¥ on the IL-6-STAT3-SOCS3 pathway . RESULTS : First , we observed that the PPAR-Œ ≤/- Œ¥ agonist GW501516 prevented both IL-6-dependent reduction in insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and glucose uptake in adipocytes . In addition , this drug treatment abolished IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes . This effect was associated with the capacity of the drug to prevent IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation on Tyr and Ser residues in vitro and in vivo . Moreover , GW501516 prevented IL-6-dependent induction of extracellular signal-related kinase 1 / 2 , a serine-threonine-protein kinase involved in serine STAT3 phosphorylation . Furthermore , in white adipose tissue from PPAR-Œ ≤/- Œ¥-null mice , STAT3 phosphorylation , STAT3 DNA-binding activity , and SOCS3 protein levels were higher than in wild-type mice . Several steps in STAT3 activation require its association with heat shock protein 90 , which was prevented by GW501516 as revealed in immunoprecipitation studies . Consistent with this finding , the STAT3-Hsp90 association was enhanced in white adipose tissue from PPAR-Œ ≤/- Œ¥-null mice compared with wild-type mice . CONCLUSIONS : Collectively , our findings indicate that PPAR-Œ ≤/- Œ¥ activation prevents IL-6-induced STAT3 activation by inhibiting ERK1 / 2 and preventing the STAT3-Hsp90 association , an effect that may contribute to the prevention of cytokine-induced insulin resistance in adipocytes . 	2011	2011-05-28	Diabetes;2011 Jul;60;7;1990-9;	Serrano-Marco,Luc√≠a,L;Rodr√≠guez-Calvo,Ricardo,R;El Kochairi,Ilhem,I;Palomer,Xavier,X;Michalik,Liliane,L;Wahli,Walter,W;V√°zquez-Carrera,Manuel,M;	-0.178285

PATIENTS AND METHOD : Prospective registry of in-hospital ISs in Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery in 13 Spanish hospitals during 2008 . Demographic , clinical and therapeutic data as well as mortality and functional evolution were recorded . RESULTS : 73 patients were included . Mean age was 72¬±11.6 years . 75.4 % of IS were cardioembolic . Special risk factors were presence of cardiac sources of embolism , prior withdrawal of antithrombotic treatment and invasive procedures . First neurological assessment was done in the first 3hours in 49.5 % and beyond 24hours from IS onset in 20.5 % . Ten patients were treated with intravenous thrombolysis , which was not possible in 8 patients because of the delay in calling the neurologist . Most frequent reasons for exclusion from thrombolytic therapy were recent major surgical procedures and anticoagulant therapy . Three-month mortality was 15 % and only 53.7 % were functionally independent . Patients treated with thrombolysis had a better evolution . CONCLUSIONS : IS in Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery are mostly cardioembolic strokes and produce a high proportion of dependent patients . Patients treated with thrombolysis had a better evolution .

ERROR 20920114: 21673098	Physiological and pharmacological mechanisms through which the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin regulates glycemia in mice . 	Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity improves glucose homeostasis through a mode of action related to the stabilization of the active forms of DPP-4-sensitive hormones such as the incretins that enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion . However , the DPP-4 enzyme is highly expressed on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells ; hence , the role of intestinal vs. systemic DPP-4 remains unclear . To analyze mechanisms through which the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin regulates glycemia in mice , we administered low oral doses of the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin that selectively reduced DPP-4 activity in the intestine . Glp1r and Gipr mice were studied and glucagon-like peptide -1 receptor signaling was blocked by an i.v. infusion of the corresponding receptor antagonist exendin . The role of the dipeptides His-Ala and Tyr-Ala as DPP-4-generated GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide degradation products was studied in vivo and in vitro on isolated islets . We demonstrate that very low doses of oral sitagliptin improve glucose tolerance and plasma insulin levels with selective reduction of intestinal but not systemic DPP-4 activity . The glucoregulatory action of sitagliptin was associated with increased vagus nerve activity and was diminished in wild-type mice treated with the GLP-1R antagonist exendin and in Glp1r and Gipr mice . Furthermore , the dipeptides liberated from GLP-1 and GIP deteriorated glucose tolerance , reduced insulin , and increased portal glucagon levels . The predominant mechanism through which DPP-4 inhibitors regulate glycemia involves local inhibition of intestinal DPP-4 activity , activation of incretin receptors , reduced liberation of bioactive dipeptides , and activation of the gut-to-pancreas neural axis . 	2011	2011-06-16	Endocrinology;2011 Aug;152;8;3018-29;	Waget,Aur√©lie,A;Cabou,Cendrine,C;Masseboeuf,Myriam,M;Cattan,Pierre,P;Armanet,Mattieu,M;Karaca,M√©lis,M;Castel,Julien,J;Garret,Celine,C;Payros,Ga√´lle,G;Maida,Adriano,A;Sulpice,Thierry,T;Holst,Jens J,JJ;Drucker,Daniel J,DJ;Magnan,Christophe,C;Burcelin,R√	-0.533087
ERROR 20954444: 21708801	Mevalonate kinase deficiency : a survey of 50 patients . 	OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to describe the spectrum of clinical signs of mevalonate kinase deficiency . METHODS : This was a retrospective French and Belgian study of patients identified on the basis of MKD gene mutations . RESULTS : Fifty patients from 38 different families were identified , including 1 asymptomatic patient . Symptoms began during the first 6 months of life in 30 patients and before the age of 5 years in 46 patients . Symptoms consisted of febrile diarrhea and/or rash in 23 of 35 patients . Febrile attacks were mostly associated with lymphadenopathy , diarrhea , joint pain , skin lesions , abdominal pain , and splenomegaly . In addition to febrile attacks , 27 patients presented with inflammatory bowel disease , erosive polyarthritis , Sj√∂gren syndrome , and other chronic neurologic , renal , pulmonary , endocrine , cutaneous , hematologic , or ocular symptoms . Recurrent and/or severe infections were observed in 13 patients , hypogammaglobulinemia in 3 patients , and renal angiomyolipoma in 3 patients . Twenty-nine genomic mutations were identified ; the p.Val377Ile mutation was the most frequently found . Three patients died of causes related to MKD . The disease remained highly active in 17 of the 31 surviving symptomatic patients followed up for &gt; 5 years , whereas disease activity decreased over time in the other 14 patients . Interleukin 1 antagonists were the most effective biological agents tested , leading to complete or partial remission in 9 of 11 patients . CONCLUSION : MKD is not only an autoinflammatory syndrome but also a multisystemic inflammatory disorder , a possible immunodeficiency disorder , and a condition that predisposes patients to the development of renal angiomyolipoma . 	2011	2011-06-29	Pediatrics;2011 Jul;128;1;e152-9;	Bader-Meunier,Brigitte,B;Florkin,Benoit,B;Sibilia,Jean,J;Acquaviva,C√©cile,C;Hachulla,Eric,E;Grateau,Gilles,G;Richer,Olivier,O;Farber,Claire Mich√®le,CM;Fischbach,Michel,M;Hentgen,V√©ronique,V;Jego,Patrick,P;Laroche,C√©cile,C;Neven,B√©n√©dicte,B;Lequerr√	-1.235

ERROR 21002582: 21762772	Effect of repeated restraint stress and clomipramine on Na+ / K+-ATPase activity and behavior in rats . 	Activation of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the release of glucocorticoids are fundamental for the adaptive response and immediate survival of an organism in reaction to acute stimuli . However , high levels of glucocorticoids in the brain may produce neuronal injury and a decrease of Na / K-ATPase activity , with effects on neurotransmitter signaling , neural activity , as well as the whole animal behavior . Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine by indirect actions on the dopaminergic system and LHPA axis . Its chronic use increases the body &apos; s ability to cope with stress ; however , high doses can potentiate its side effects on memory , learning , and sensory motor function . The purpose of the present study was to compare the effect of repeated restraint stress and clomipramine treatment on Na / K-ATPase activity and on the behavior of male rats . Changes in the behavioral response were evaluated by measuring the memory , learning , anxiety , and exploratory responses . Our results showed that exposure to repeated restraint stress reduced levels of Na / K-ATPase in brain structures and changed short and long-term memory , learning , and exploratory response when compared to the control group . Exposure to clomipramine treatment increased anxiety levels and reduced Na / K-ATPase activity in the cerebral cortex as well as short term memory , learning , and exploratory response . In conclusion , the present results provide additional evidence concerning how repeated restraint stress and clomipramine chronically administered at higher dose levels affect the neural activity and behavior of male rats . 	2011	2011-07-19	International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience;2011 Dec;29;8;909-16;	Balk,Rodrigo de Souza,Rde S;Silva,Michele Hinerasky da,MH;Bridi,Jessika Cristina,JC;Carvalho,Nelson Rodrigues,NR;Portella,Rafael de Lima,Rde L;Dobrachinski,Fernando,F;Amaral,Guilherme Pires,GP;Barcelos,R√¥mulo,R;Dias,Glaecir Roseni Mundstock,GR;Rocha,Jo√	-1.36427

ERROR 21055351: 21817957	Response to primary and booster vaccination with 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine in Korean infants . 	BACKGROUND : This randomized single-blind study in Korea evaluated noninferiority of the 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine versus the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine when both were coadministered with H. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine , as opposed to coadministration with diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis-based combination vaccines in previous studies . METHODS : Infants received 3 primary doses at 2 , 4 , and 6 months and a booster dose at 12 to 18 months of PHiD-CV or 7vCRM , both coadministered with Hib vaccine . Immune responses were measured 1 month postdose 3 and postbooster using 22F-inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and functional opsonophagocytic activity assay . RESULTS : PHiD-CV-induced antibody responses against each of the vaccine pneumococcal serotypes and protein D . Noninferiority to 7vCRM was demonstrated for all 10 PHiD-CV serotypes in terms of percentages of subjects reaching an antibody concentration ‚â•0.2 Œºg / mL after primary vaccination . Postprimary and postbooster , percentages of subjects with antibody concentration ‚â•0.2 Œºg / mL or opsonophagocytic activity titer ‚â•8 were generally consistent between groups for each pneumococcal serotype common to both vaccines .

Metallothioneins are a family of small , cysteine-rich proteins with many functions . Immunohistochemical evaluation of all metallothionein 1 + 2 isoforms in colorectal tumors has demonstrated an important down-regulation compared with normal tissue , although its prognostic significance is unclear . Moreover , the contribution of individual isoforms to overall metallothionein down-regulation is not known . To address these important issues , we analyzed the messenger RNA expression levels of all functional metallothionein 1 + 2 isoforms by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 22 pairs of normal and tumor-microdissected epithelia and correlated these to the overall immunohistochemical protein expression . Our results showed that 5 isoforms were lost during the transition from normal mucosa to tumor , whereas MT1X and MT2A were less down-regulated , and their expression was correlated with overall protein positivity . Second , we showed that MT1G hypermethylation occurred in cell lines and in 29 % of tumor samples , whereas histone deacetylase inhibitors are able to induce most isoforms . Furthermore , we analyzed by immunohistochemistry 107 normal mucosae , 25 adenomas , 81 carcinomas , and 19 lymph node metastases to evaluate metallothionein expression during different stages of cancer development and to assess its relationship to patient survival . A lower immunohistochemical expression was associated with poorer survival , although it was not an independent predictor . Overall , this study identifies for the first time the relevant metallothionein isoforms for colorectal cancer progression , supports the concept that their loss is associated with worse prognosis , and suggests 2 mechanisms for epigenetic repression of metallothionein expression in colorectal tumors . 	2011	2011-08-09	Human pathology;2012 Feb;43;2;197-208;	Arriaga,Juan Mart√≠n,JM;Levy,Estrella Mariel,EM;Bravo,Alicia In√©s,AI;Bayo,Sergio Morales,SM;Amat,Mora,M;Aris,Mariana,M;Hannois,Adri√°n,A;Bruno,Luisina,L;Roberti,Mar√≠a Paula,MP;Loria,Fernando S√°nchez,FS;Pairola,Alejandro,A;Huertas,Eduardo,E;Mordoh,Jos√	-1.391

Liver regeneration may take place after liver injury through replication of hepatocytes or hepatic progenitor cells called oval cells . Interferons are natural cytokines with pleiotrophic effects including antiviral and antiproliferative actions . No data are yet available on the physiology and cellular source of natural IFNs during liver regeneration . To address this issue , we have analyzed the levels and biologic activities of IFN-Œ± / IFN-Œ≥ in two models of partial hepatectomy . After 2 / 3rd partial hepatectomy , hepatic levels of IFN-Œ± and IFN-Œ≥ declined transiently in contrast to a transient increase of the IFN-Œ≥ serum level . After administration of 2-acetylaminofluorene and partial hepatectomy , however , both IFN-Œ± and IFN-Œ≥ expression were up-regulated in regenerating livers . Again , the IFN-Œ≥ serum level was transiently increased . Whereas hepatic IFN-Œ≥ was up-regulated early , but not significantly , in the AAF / PH model , IFN-Œ± was significantly up-regulated at later time points in parallel to the peak of oval cell proliferation . Biological activity of IFN-Œ± was shown by activation of IFN-Œ±-specific signal transduction and induction of IFN-Œ± specific-gene expression . We found a significant infiltration of the liver with inflammatory monocyte-like mononuclear phagocytes concomitant to the frequency of oval cells . We localized IFN-Œ± production only in MNPs , but not in oval cells . These events were not observed in normal liver regeneration after standard PH . We conclude that IFN-Œ≥ functions as an acute-phase cytokine in both models of liver regeneration and may constitute a systemic component of liver regeneration . IFN-Œ± was increased only in the AAF / PH model , and was associated with proliferation of oval cells . However , oval cells seem not to be the source of IFN-Œ± . Instead , inflammatory MNP infiltrating AAF / PH-treated livers produce IFN-Œ± . These inflammatory MNPs may be involved in the regulation of the oval cell compartment through local expression of cytokines , including IFN-Œ± . 	2011	2011-08-09	Histochemistry and cell biology;2011 Aug;136;2;131-44;	Batusic,Danko S,DS;von Bargen,Alexander,A;Blaschke,Sabine,S;Dudas,Jozsef,J;Ramadori,Giuliano,G;	-1.26493

In Arabidopsis , Hexokinase1 is a glucose sensor that may trigger abscisic acid synthesis and sensitivity to mediate glucose-induced inhibition of seedling development . Here , we show that the intensity of short-term responses to glucose can vary with ABA activity . We report that the transient repression by 2 % glucose of AtbZIP63 , a gene encoding a basic-leucine zipper transcription factor partially involved in the Snf1-related kinase KIN10-induced responses to energy limitation , is independent of HXK1 and is not mediated by changes in ABA levels . However , high-concentration glucose-mediated repression appears to be modulated by ABA , since full repression of AtbZIP63 requires a functional ABA biosynthetic pathway . Furthermore , the combination of glucose and ABA was able to trigger a synergistic repression of AtbZIP63 and its homologue AtbZIP3 , revealing a shared regulatory feature consisting of the modulation of glucose sensitivity by ABA . The synergistic regulation of AtbZIP63 was not reproduced by an AtbZIP63 promoter-5 &apos; -untranslated region : : Œ≤-glucuronidase fusion , thus suggesting possible posttranscriptional control . A transcriptional inhibition assay with cordycepin provided further evidence for the regulation of mRNA decay in response to glucose plus ABA .

ERROR 21093870: 21858243	Prevalence and factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection of dogs from an urban area of Brazil as identified by molecular methods . 	BACKGROUND : Various factors contribute to the urbanization of the visceral leishmaniasis , including the difficulties of implementing control measures relating to the domestic reservoir . The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in an urban endemic area in Brazil and the factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection among seronegative and PCR-positive dogs . METHODOLOGY : A cross-sectional study was conducted in Belo Horizonte , Minas Gerais , Brazil . Blood samples were collected from 1,443 dogs . Serology was carried out by using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays , and molecular methods were developed , including PCR-RFLP . To identify the factors associated with early stages of infection , only seronegative animals were evaluated . These animals were divided into two groups : PCR-positive and PCR-negative for L. infantum DNA . A comparison of these two groups of dogs taking into consideration the characteristics of the animals and their owners was performed . A mixed logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with L. infantum infection . PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Of the 1,443 dogs examined , 230 were seropositive in at least one ELISA , whereas PCR-RFLP revealed that 356 animals were positive for L. infantum DNA . Results indicated that the associated factors with infection were family income &lt; twice the Brazilian minimum salary , knowledge of the owner regarding the vector , the dog staying predominantly in the backyard , and a lack of previous serological examination for VL . CONCLUSIONS : PCR detected a high prevalence of L. infantum infection in dogs in an area under the Control Program of VL intervention . Socioeconomic variables , dog behavior and the knowledge of the owner regarding the vector were factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniasis . The absence of previous serological examination conducted by the control program was also associated with L. infantum infection .

We have used maDCs as a model system to analyze the mechanisms whereby CXCL12 simultaneously controls chemotaxis and survival in maDCs . We show that CXCL12 uses CXCR4 , but not CXCR7 , and the components of a signaling core that includes G / GŒ≤Œ≥ , PI3K-Œ ±/- Œ ¥/- Œ≥ , Akt , ERK1 / 2 and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 , which organize hierarchically to control both functions . Downstream of Akt , Forkhead box class O regulates CXCL12-dependent survival , but not chemotaxis , suggesting that downstream of the aforementioned signaling core , additional signaling molecules may control more selectively CXCL12-dependent chemotaxis or survival . Finally , the data obtained also show that CXCR4 uses a signaling signature that is different from that used by CCR7 to control similar functions . 	2011	2011-09-01	The Journal of biological chemistry;2011 Oct 28;286;43;37222-36;	Delgado-Mart√≠n,Cristina,C;Escribano,Cristina,C;Pablos,Jos√© Luis,JL;Riol-Blanco,Lorena,L;Rodr√≠guez-Fern√°ndez,Jos√© Luis,JL;	-0.229198
ERROR 21120046: 21885626	Telomere dysfunction causes sustained inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 	RATIONALE : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with chronic inflammation of unknown pathogenesis . OBJECTIVES : To investigate whether telomere dysfunction and senescence of pulmonary vascular endothelial cells induce inflammation in COPD . METHODS : Prospective comparison of patients with COPD and age- and sex-matched control smokers . Investigation of mice null for telomerase reverse transcriptase or telomerase RNA component genes . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : In situ lung specimen studies showed a higher percentage of senescent P-ECs stained for p16 and p21 in patients with COPD than in control subjects . Cultured P-ECs from patients with COPD exhibited early replicative senescence , with decreased cell-population doublings , a higher percentage of Œ≤-galactosidase-positive cells , reduced telomerase activity , shorter telomeres , and higher p16 and p21 mRNA levels at an early cell passage compared with control subjects . Senescent P-ECs released cytokines and mediators : the levels of IL-6 , IL-8 , monocyte chemotactic protein -1 , Hu-GRO , and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule -1 were elevated in the media of P-ECs from patients compared with control subjects at an early cell passage , in proportion to the senescent P-EC increase and telomere shortening . Up-regulation of MCP-1 and sICAM-1 led to increased monocyte adherence and migration . The elevated MCP-1 , IL-8 , Hu-GROŒ± , and ICAM-1 levels measured in lungs from patients compared with control subjects correlated with P-EC senescence criteria and telomere length . In Tert and/or Terc mouse lungs , levels of the corresponding cytokines were also altered , despite the absence of external stimuli and in proportion to telomere dysfunction . CONCLUSIONS : Telomere dysfunction and premature P-EC senescence are major processes perpetuating lung inflammation in COPD . 	2011	2011-09-03	American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine;2011 Dec 15;184;12;1358-66;	Amsellem,Valerie,V;Gary-Bobo,Guillaume,G;Marcos,Elisabeth,E;Maitre,Bernard,B;Chaar,Vicky,V;Validire,Pierre,P;Stern,Jean-Baptiste,JB;Noureddine,Hiba,H;Sapin,Elise,E;Rideau,Dominique,D;Hue,Sophie,S;Le Corvoisier,Philippe,P;Le Gouvello,Sabine,S;Dubois-Rand√	-1.12145
ERROR 21139640: 21907007	Evaluation of efficacy and safety of FOLFIRI for elderly patients with gastric cancer : a first-line phase II study . 	OBJECTIVE : Current chemotherapy protocols for gastric cancer present high toxicity . The FOLFIRI regimen has shown promising results with elderly colorectal cancer patients and for gastric cancer patients but this is the first report on elderly gastric cancer patients . DESIGN : In this multicenter non-randomized phase II trial , we administered the FOLFIRI chemotherapy protocol to patients aged over 70 years with locally-advanced or metastatic gastric cancer combined with Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment . Responses were assessed at 2 months . RESULTS : Forty-two patients received eight cycles of the FOLFIRI regimen , with 82.5 % of patients showing disease control : 10 patients showing objective responses and 23 showing stable disease . One-year overall survival was 41.5 % and one-year progression-free survival was 31.8 % . We observed 10 Grade 3 / 4 hematologic toxicities with one febrile neutropenia . CGA data demonstrated that geriatric functions were not altered by treatment and that nutritional status improved over treatment . CONCLUSIONS : Results show excellent disease control and relatively high survival rates with limited toxicity similar to younger patients indicating that this regimen should be considered as a possible treatment in advanced gastric cancer of the elderly . 	2011	2011-09-13	Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology;2011 Dec;35;12;823-30;	Fonck,Marianne,M;Brunet,R√©n√©,R;Becouarn,Yves,Y;Legoux,Jean-Louis,JL;Dauba,J√©r√¥me,J;Cany,Laurent,L;Smith,Denis,D;Auby,Dominique,D;Terrebonne,Eric,E;Traissac,Laurent,L;Mertens,C√©cile,C;Soubeyran,Pierre,P;Bellera,Carine,C;Rainfray,Muriel,M;Mathoulin-P√	-1.27312
ERROR 21145331: 21912907	The influence of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea on metabolic hormones . 	BACKGROUND : Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness and repetitive upper airway obstruction episodes during sleep . Clinically , obesity is a major risk factor for developing OSAS . However , OSAS has been associated with hormonal and metabolic alterations that could predispose patients to obesity . The aim of this study was to investigate the independent role of apneas and obesity on plasma levels of metabolic hormones in patients with OSAS . METHODS : We have studied patients with OSAS and controls with and without obesity . All patients were male , had an apnea-hypopnea index of 20 / h or greater , and were eligible for nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment . Patients were considered obese when their BMI was higher than 30 kg / m and non-obese when it was lower than 27 kg / m . Non-obese control subjects were non-snorers with a normal cardiorespiratory sleep study , while obese control subjects were recruited from those obese subjects who were visited in our sleep unit and for whom OSAS was excluded by full polysomnography . A single blood sample was obtained from an antecubital vein in all participants after the completion of the nocturnal sleep laboratory recording . Plasma leptin , adiponectin , and ghrelin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay . RESULTS : The adiponectin , ghrelin , and leptin plasma levels were similar in both patients and controls . There were differences in leptin and adiponectin plasma levels between the obese and non-obese in both patient and control groups . In the case of ghrelin , differences between obese and non-obese subjects were only seen in patients . There were no significant differences in hormone levels between the obese controls and obese patients or between non-obese controls and non-obese patients . After 3 months of nCPAP treatment , adiponectin levels decreased significantly both in obese and non-obese patients , and leptin levels decreased in obese patients . Finally , nCPAP did not reduce ghrelin in either obese or non-obese patients . CONCLUSIONS : The basal levels of leptin , adiponectin , and ghrelin were mostly associated with obesity . We found that sleep apnea was not a determinant factor in leptin , adiponectin , and ghrelin hormonal levels . Interestingly , nCPAP treatment diminishes leptin in obese OSA patients and adiponectin levels in obese and non-obese patients with OSAS . 	2011	2011-09-14	Sleep &amp; breathing = Schlaf &amp; Atmung;2012 Sep;16;3;649-56;	S√°nchez-de-la-Torre,Manuel,M;Mediano,Olga,O;Barcel√≥,Antonia,A;Pi√©rola,Javier,J;de la Pe√±a,Monica,M;Esquinas,Cristina,C;Miro,Angelina,A;Dur√°n-Cantolla,Joaquin,J;Agust√≠,Alvar G,AG;Capote,Francisco,F;Marin,Jose Maria,JM;Montserrat,Josep Maria,JM;Garc√	-1.42913

Vaccinia virus has been associated with several exanthematic outbreaks in bovine , human , and equine species in Brazilian rural areas . Little is known about VACV reservoirs , although it is believed that rodents could be associated with VACV outbreaks . With the goal of filling one more gap in the VACV ecological puzzle , the present work aimed at mimicking a potential transmission route of VACV between cows and rodents , both known as natural VACV hosts . Balb / c mice were exposed to feces of experimentally VACV infected cows for 20 days , and samples from these mice were examined by using molecular and serological tests . VACV DNA was detected in feces and blood samples after several days of exposure ; infectious VACV particles were also detected in the feces . The presence of anti-VACV neutralizing antibodies in murine sera further suggested horizontal transmission . If the transmission model described here can be applied to natural environments , exposure to bovine feces could be considered a risk factor for the spread of VACV ; consequently , the traditional use of bovine manure as a fertilizer in agricultural activities may be promoting the infection of rodents . 	2011	2011-09-20	Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.);2012 Jan;12;1;61-4;	D&apos;Anuncia√ß√£o,Lorena,L;Guedes,Maria Isabel Maldonado,MI;Oliveira,T√©rcia Ludolfo,TL;Rehfeld,Izabelle,I;Bonjardim,Cl√°udio Ant√¥nio,CA;Ferreira,Paulo Peregrino,PP;Trindade,Giliane de Souza,Gde S;Lobato,Z√©lia Portela,ZP;Kroon,Erna Geessien,EG;Abrah√	-1.05998
ERROR 21162339: 21931130	WDR36 and P53 gene variants and susceptibility to primary open-angle glaucoma : analysis of gene-gene interactions . 	PURPOSE : To investigate the role of WDR36 and P53 sequence variations in POAG susceptibility . METHODS : The authors performed a case-control genetic association study in 268 unrelated Spanish patients and 380 control subjects matched for sex , age , and ethnicity . WDR36 sequence variations were screened by either direct DNA sequencing or denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography . P53 polymorphisms p.R72P and c.97-147ins16bp were analyzed by single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and PCR , respectively . Positive SNP and haplotype associations were reanalyzed in a second sample of 211 patients and in combined cases . RESULTS : The authors identified almost 50 WDR36 sequence variations , of which approximately two-thirds were rare and one-third were polymorphisms . Approximately half the variants were novel . Eight patients carried rare mutations that were not identified in the control group . Six Tag SNPs were expected to be structured in three common haplotypes . Haplotype H2 was consistently associated with the disease . According to a dominant model , genotypes containing allele P of the P53 p.R72P SNP slightly increased glaucoma risk . Glaucoma susceptibility associated with different WDR36 genotypes also increased significantly in combination with the P53 RP risk genotype , indicating the existence of a genetic interaction . For instance , the OR of the H2 diplotype estimated for POAG1 and combined cases rose approximately 1.6 times in the two-locus genotype H2 / RP . CONCLUSIONS : Rare WDR36 variants and the P53 p.R72P polymorphism behaved as moderate glaucoma risk factors in Spanish patients . The authors provide evidence for a genetic interaction between WDR36 and P53 variants in POAG susceptibility , although this finding must be confirmed in other populations . 	2011	2011-09-21	Investigative ophthalmology &amp; visual science;2011 Oct;52;11;8467-78;	Blanco-Marchite,Cristina,C;S√°nchez-S√°nchez,Francisco,F;L√≥pez-Garrido,Mar√≠a-Pilar,MP;I√±igez-de-Onzo√±o,Mercedes,M;L√≥pez-Mart√≠nez,Francisco,F;L√≥pez-S√°nchez,Enrique,E;Alvarez,Lydia,L;Rodr√≠guez-Calvo,Pedro-Pablo,PP;M√©ndez-Hern√°ndez,Carmen,C;Fern√	-0.59896
ERROR 21163020: 21931841	Environmental levels of the antiviral oseltamivir induce development of resistance mutation H274Y in influenza A / H1N1 virus in mallards . 	Oseltamivir is the most widely used drug against influenza infections and is extensively stockpiled worldwide as part of pandemic preparedness plans . However , resistance is a growing problem and in 2008-2009 , seasonal human influenza A / H1N1 virus strains in most parts of the world carried the mutation H274Y in the neuraminidase gene which causes resistance to the drug . The active metabolite of oseltamivir , oseltamivir carboxylate , is poorly degraded in sewage treatment plants and surface water and has been detected in aquatic environments where the natural influenza reservoir , dabbling ducks , can be exposed to the substance . To assess if resistance can develop under these circumstances , we infected mallards with influenza A / H1N1 virus and exposed the birds to 80 ng / L , 1 ¬µg / L and 80 ¬µg / L of OC through their sole water source . By sequencing the neuraminidase gene from fecal samples , we found that H274Y occurred at 1 ¬µg / L of OC and rapidly dominated the viral population at 80 ¬µg / L . IC‚ÇÖ‚ÇÄ for OC was increased from 2-4 nM in wild-type viruses to 400-700 nM in H274Y mutants as measured by a neuraminidase inhibition assay . This is consistent with the decrease in sensitivity to OC that has been noted among human clinical isolates carrying H274Y . Environmental OC levels have been measured to 58-293 ng / L during seasonal outbreaks and are expected to reach ¬µg / L-levels during pandemics . Thus , resistance could be induced in influenza viruses circulating among wild ducks . As influenza viruses can cross species barriers , oseltamivir resistance could spread to human-adapted strains with pandemic potential disabling oseltamivir , a cornerstone in pandemic preparedness planning . We propose surveillance in wild birds as a measure to understand the resistance situation in nature and to monitor it over time . Strategies to lower environmental levels of OC include improved sewage treatment and , more importantly , a prudent use of antivirals . 	2011	2011-09-21	PloS one;2011;6;9;e24742;	J√§rhult,Josef D,JD;Muradrasoli,Shaman,S;Wahlgren,John,J;S√∂derstr√∂m,Hanna,H;Orozovic,Goran,G;Gunnarsson,Gunnar,G;Br√∂jer,Caroline,C;Latorre-Margalef,Neus,N;Fick,Jerker,J;Grabic,Roman,R;Lennerstrand,Johan,J;Waldenstr√∂m,Jonas,J;Lundkvist,Ake,A;Olsen,Bj√	-1.33922

Inositol Inpp5k is a member of the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases family with a poorly characterized function in vivo . In this study , we explored the function of this inositol 5-phosphatase in mice and cells overexpressing the 42-kDa mouse Inpp5k protein . Inpp5k transgenic mice present defects in water metabolism characterized by a reduced plasma osmolality at baseline , a delayed urinary water excretion following a water load , and an increased acute response to vasopressin . These defects are associated with the expression of the Inpp5k transgene in renal collecting ducts and with alterations in the arginine vasopressin / aquaporin-2 signalling pathway in this tubular segment . Analysis in a mouse collecting duct mCCD cell line revealed that Inpp5k overexpression leads to increased expression of the arginine vasopressin receptor type 2 and increased cAMP response to arginine vasopressin , providing a basis for increased aquaporin-2 expression and plasma membrane localization with increased osmotically induced water transport . Altogether , our results indicate that Inpp5k 5-phosphatase is important for the control of the arginine vasopressin / aquaporin-2 signalling pathway and water transport in kidney collecting ducts . 	2011	2011-09-23	Pfl√ºgers Archiv : European journal of physiology;2011 Dec;462;6;871-83;	Pernot,Eileen,E;Terryn,Sara,S;Cheong,Siew Chiat,SC;Markadieu,Nicolas,N;Janas,Sylvie,S;Blockmans,Marianne,M;Jacoby,Monique,M;Pouillon,Val√©rie,V;Gayral,St√©phanie,S;Rossier,Bernard C,BC;Beauwens,Renaud,R;Erneux,Christophe,C;Devuyst,Olivier,O;Schurmans,St√	-0.764347

It is well known that cell surface immune receptors play a critical role in regulating immune and inflammatory processes in the central nervous system . We have analyzed the function of cluster of differentiation 300f immunoreceptor in a model of excitotoxic rat brain damage . First , to explore the presence of endogenous ligand for this receptor we used a human CD300f-Ig soluble protein and confocal microscopy , showing specific staining mainly in CNS white matter and on the surface of oligodendrocytes and certain astrocytes . Next , we demonstrated in a model of in vivo rat brain excitotoxic damage that the overexpression of human CD300f induced a significant reduction in the lesion volume . To validate these results , we cloned the rat ortholog of CD300f protein . The overexpression of rCD300f receptor had a comparable neuroprotective effect after the acute brain injury and a similar CNS staining pattern when stained with the rCD300f-Ig soluble protein . Interestingly , when we analyzed the expression pattern of rCD300f in brain cells by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry , we detected the expression of CD300f as expected in microglial cells , but also in oligodendrocytes and neurons . These data suggest that the neuroprotective role of CD300f would be the result of a complex network of cell interactions . 	2011	2011-09-29	Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland);2012 May;22;3;318-28;	Peluffo,Hugo,H;Al√≠-Ruiz,Daniela,D;Ejarque-Ort√≠z,Aroa,A;Heras-Alvarez,Victor,V;Comas-Casellas,Emma,E;Mart√≠nez-Barriocanal,Agueda,A;Kamaid,Andres,A;Alvarez-Errico,Damiana,D;Negro,Maria Luciana,ML;Lago,Natalia,N;Schwartz,Sim√≥,S;Villaverde,Antonio,A;Say√	-0.52469

A prospective , open-labelled , multicentre 6-month study was designed to assess three categories that have high impact on Health-Related Quality of Life . These categories were : satisfaction , preference and drug tolerability in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis in Croatia , at first treated with weekly oral bisphosphonates , followed by monthly oral ibandronate . Three hundred eighty-five postmenopausal women who were treated with one of the weekly bisphosphonates for at least 6¬†months were included into the study and after they had signed written informed consent , the therapy was changed to monthly ibandronate . Satisfaction with the treatment was assessed with the Osteoporosis Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire . Patients completed OPSAT-Q at the baseline visit before the change of therapy and 6¬†months after the change of therapy . Following 6¬†months ibandronate therapy , the values in all four domains of the OPSAT-Q as well as in the Composite Satisfaction Score were higher in visit 2 . Values in subjects enrolled into the patient assistance programme did not differ significantly from the values in subjects that were not except for the domain convenience . This study demonstrates significantly higher satisfaction in patients who switched from the weekly bisphosphonate therapy regimen to monthly ibandronate in all observed aspects of treatment . Patients expressed preference for monthly bisphosphonate in comparison with weekly bisphosphonates and found it to be a more convenient method of treatment .

Rubella is a contagious viral disease with few complications except when contracted by pregnant women . Rubella infection in pregnancy can result in miscarriage , stillbirth or an infant born with congenital rubella syndrome which comprises deafness , heart disease , cataracts and other permanent congenital manifestations . Clinical diagnosis of rubella is difficult due to overlapping symptoms with many other diseases and confirmation of rubella is not possible without laboratory testing . Effective vaccination programmes are critical to the elimination of rubella and prevention of CRS . Such programmes have been successful in several countries in Europe and around the world . However , rubella outbreaks still occur due to suboptimal vaccine coverage and in the past 10 years rubella has been reported in Central European countries such as Romania and Poland . Over the past decade the elimination of rubella and prevention of congenital rubella infection in Europe has been a high priority for the WHO European Regional Office . In 2010 the WHO regional committee for Europe renewed its commitment to the elimination of rubella and prevention of CRS with a new target of 2015 . This paper examines the current situation for rubella and CRS in Central Europe and describes the different rubella vaccination programmes in the region . The Central European Vaccination Advisory Group recommends that two doses of measles , mumps and rubella vaccine , MMR , should be given to all children . The first dose should be given between 12 and 15 months of age . The second dose can be given between the ages of 21 months and 13 years with the exact age of administration of the second dose depending on the situation specific to each country . All suspected rubella cases should be laboratory-confirmed and monitoring systems to detect and investigate cases of CRS should be strengthened . 	2011	2011-10-06	Vaccine;2011 Nov 15;29;49;9141-7;	Usonis,Vytautas,V;Anca,Ioana,I;Andr√©,Francis,F;Chlibek,Roman,R;Ci≈æman,Milan,M;Ivaskeviciene,Inga,I;Mangarov,Atanas,A;M√©szner,Zs√≥fia,Z;Perenovska,Penka,P;Pokorn,Marko,M;Prymula,Roman,R;Richter,Darko,D;Salman,Nuran,N;Simurka,Pavol,P;Tamm,Eda,E;Te≈°oviƒ	-1.41572

DESIGN : We analyzed chromosome 12p11.2-q13.1 haplotypes in 14 late-onset Parkinson &apos; s disease families without known LRRK2 mutations . RESULTS : Haplotype analysis identified 12 families in which the affected subjects shared chromosome 12p11.2-q13.1 haplotypes . LRRK2 sequencing revealed a novel co-segregating missense mutation in exon 36 located within a highly conserved region of the COR domain wherein it could deregulate LRRK2 kinase activity by modifying ROC-COR dimer stability . p.S1761R was present in a late-onset Parkinson &apos; s disease family and in 2 unrelated Parkinson &apos; s disease subjects , but not in 2491 healthy controls .

In lupus , calcifications were detected since the age of 23 years and from 3 years of diagnosis . Patients with calcifications were older , post-menopausal , and had higher levels of serum apolipoprotein B and Framingham risk scores . Lupus-related factors identified included age at diagnosis , IgG aCLs , cumulative lupus activity , length of moderate / severe activity and cumulative dose of prednisone and CYC . Use of anti-malarials was protective . Logistic regression analysis showed as predictors of calcification : disease duration , age at enrolment and SLEDAI 2000 update mean area under the curve . Longitudinal analyses of lipids and inflammatory molecules did not differ between patients . CONCLUSIONS : Disease activity is a potentially modifiable risk factor for coronary artery calcifications in SLE . Therefore , management of traditional risk factors plus tight control of lupus activity , including the use of anti-malarials , is recommended . 	2011	2011-11-01	Rheumatology (Oxford, England);2012 Jan;51;1;110-9;	Romero-D√≠az,Juanita,J;Vargas-V√≥rackov√°,Florencia,F;Kimura-Hayama,Erick,E;Cort√°zar-Ben√≠tez,Luis F,LF;Gij√≥n-Mitre,Rub√©n,R;Criales,Sergio,S;Cabiedes-Contreras,Javier,J;I√±iguez-Rodr√≠guez,Mar√≠a Del Roc√≠o,Mdel R;Lara-Garc√≠a,Eunice Alejandra,EA;N√∫√	-1.27555

ERROR 21269649: 22046132	The SARS-coronavirus-host interactome : identification of cyclophilins as target for pan-coronavirus inhibitors . 	Coronaviruses are important human and animal pathogens that induce fatal respiratory , gastrointestinal and neurological disease . The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002 / 2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to CoV epidemics . Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs . Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets . In this study , we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 . These molecules modulate the Calcineurin / NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation . Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin / NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2 , compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases . Conversely , inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera , including SARS-CoV , human CoV-229E and -NL-63 , feline CoV , as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus . Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of humans and livestock . 	2011	2011-11-03	PLoS pathogens;2011 Oct;7;10;e1002331;	Pfefferle,Susanne,S;Sch√∂pf,Julia,J;K√∂gl,Manfred,M;Friedel,Caroline C,CC;M√ºller,Marcel A,MA;Carbajo-Lozoya,Javier,J;Stellberger,Thorsten,T;von Dall&apos;Armi,Ekatarina,E;Herzog,Petra,P;Kallies,Stefan,S;Niemeyer,Daniela,D;Ditt,Vanessa,V;Kuri,Thomas,T;Z√	-0.519688

To date , only a few cases of &quot; rosette forming t , HMB45-positive renal carcinoma &quot; have been published . In this article , we contribute further data on 4 cases of this rare entity . Patients were 3 women and 1 man with an age range of 20 to 54 years . Follow-up did not reveal any metastatic events or recurrences . All tumors were well circumscribed and mostly encapsulated with homogeneous gray to tan cut surfaces . No necrosis was seen . All tumors displayed a solid or solid / alveolar architecture and contained occasionally long and branching tubular structures composed of discohesive neoplastic cells and pseudorosettes . The presence of pseudorosettes was a constant finding , but the number of pseudorosettes varied significantly among cases . All cases displayed focal immunoreactivity for the melanocytic marker HMB45 , cathepsin K , and vimentin . Melan A , tyrosinase , cytokeratins , CD10 , and microphthalmia transcription factor were each positive in 3 of 4 cases . On ultrastructural examination , numerous electron-dense secretory cytoplasmic granules with some resemblance to melanosomes were identified . The pseudorosettes were composed of reduplicated basement membrane material surrounded by small lymphocyte-like neoplastic cells . Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction , 2 tumors were positive for the Alpha-TFEB fusion transcript . The presence of the translocation t was confirmed in 2 analyzed cases . No von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene mutation , promotor methylation or loss of heterozygosity of 3p was found .

ERROR 21275691: 22052435	Spectroscopic , morphological , and mechanistic investigation of the solvent-promoted aggregation of porphyrins modified in meso-positions by glucosylated steroids . 	Solvent-driven aggregation of a series of porphyrin derivatives was studied by UV / Vis and circular dichroism spectroscopy . The porphyrins are characterised by the presence in the meso positions of steroidal moieties further conjugated with glucosyl groups . The presence of these groups makes the investigated macrocycles amphiphilic and soluble in aqueous solvent , namely , dimethyl acetamide / water . Aggregation of the macrocycles is triggered by a change in bulk solvent composition leading to formation of large architectures that express supramolecular chirality , steered by the presence of the stereogenic centres on the periphery of the macrocycles . The aggregation behaviour and chiroptical features of the aggregates are strongly dependent on the number of moieties decorating the periphery of the porphyrin framework . In particular , experimental evidence indicates that the structure of the steroid linker dictates the overall chirality of the supramolecular architectures . Moreover , the porphyrin concentration strongly affects the aggregation mechanism and the CD intensities of the spectra . Notably , AFM investigations reveal strong differences in aggregate morphology that are dependent on the nature of the appended functional groups , and closely in line with the changes in aggregation mechanism . The suprastructures formed at lower concentration show a network of long fibrous structures spanning over tens of micrometres , whereas the aggregates formed at higher concentration have smaller rod-shaped structures that can be recognised as the result of coalescence of smaller globular structures . The fully steroid substituted derivative forms globular structures over the whole concentration range explored . Finally , a rationale for the aggregation phenomena was given by semiempirical calculations at the PM6 level . 	2011	2011-11-05	Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany);2011 Dec 2;17;49;13743-53;	Zelenka,Karel,K;Trnka,Tom√°≈°,T;Ti≈°lerov√°,Iva,I;Monti,Donato,D;Cinti,Stefano,S;Naitana,Mario Luigi,ML;Schiaffino,Luca,L;Venanzi,Mariano,M;Laguzzi,Giuseppe,G;Luvidi,Loredana,L;Mancini,Giovanna,G;Nov√°kov√°,Zdena,Z;≈†im√°k,Ond≈ôej,O;Wimmer,Zdenƒõk,Z;Dra≈	-1.69599
ERROR 21279835: 22056721	Molecular genetic and functional association of Brugada and early repolarization syndromes with S422L missense mutation in KCNJ8 . 	BACKGROUND : Adenosine triphosphate -sensitive potassium cardiac channels consist of inward-rectifying channel subunits Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 and the sulfonylurea receptor subunits SUR2A . OBJECTIVE : To examine the association of mutations in KCNJ8 with Brugada syndrome and early repolarization syndrome and to elucidate the mechanism underlying the gain of function of ATP-sensitive potassium channel current . METHODS : Direct sequencing of KCNJ8 and other candidate genes was performed on 204 BrS and ERS probands and family members . Whole-cell and inside-out patch-clamp methods were used to study mutated channels expressed in TSA201 cells . RESULTS : The same missense mutation , p.Ser422Leu in KCNJ8 , was identified in 3 BrS and 1 ERS probands but was absent in 430 alleles from ethnically matched healthy controls . Additional genetic variants included CACNB2b-D601E . Whole-cell patch-clamp studies showed a 2-fold gain of function of glibenclamide-sensitive ATP-sensitive potassium channel current when KCNJ8-S422L was coexpressed with SUR2A-wild type . Inside-out patch-clamp evaluation yielded a significantly greater half maximal inhibitory concentration for ATP in the mutant channels , pointing to incomplete closing of the ATP-sensitive potassium channels under normoxic conditions . Patients with a CACNB2b-D601E polymorphism displayed longer QT / corrected QT intervals , likely owing to their effect to induce an increase in L-type calcium channel current . CONCLUSIONS : Our results support the hypothesis that KCNJ8 is a susceptibility gene for BrS and ERS and point to S422L as a possible hotspot mutation . Our findings suggest that the S422L-induced gain of function in ATP-sensitive potassium channel current is due to reduced sensitivity to intracellular ATP . 	2011	2011-11-08	Heart rhythm : the official journal of the Heart Rhythm Society;2012 Apr;9;4;548-55;	Barajas-Mart√≠nez,Hector,H;Hu,Dan,D;Ferrer,Tania,T;Onetti,Carlos G,CG;Wu,Yuesheng,Y;Burashnikov,Elena,E;Boyle,Madalene,M;Surman,Tyler,T;Urrutia,Janire,J;Veltmann,Christian,C;Schimpf,Rainer,R;Borggrefe,Martin,M;Wolpert,Christian,C;Ibrahim,Bassiema B,BB;S√	-0.675843

BACKGROUND : In patients with refractory steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome , treatment with rituximab has shown encouraging results ; however , long-term follow-up data are not available . METHODS : We performed a retrospective analysis of 37 patients with steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome who were treated with rituximab . Long-term follow-up data are available for 29 patients . RESULTS : Twenty-six of 37 patients remained in remission after 12 months . Relapses occurred in 24 patients after a median of 9.6 months . Time to first relapse was significantly shorter in patients receiving one or two compared to three or four initial infusions . In the 29 patients with long-term follow-up for &gt; 2 years , 12 patients remained in remission after the initial rituximab course for &gt; 24 months , 7 patients without further maintenance immunosuppression . Nineteen children received two to four repeated courses of rituximab increasing the total number of patients with long-term remission to 20 , remission including 14 patients off immunosuppression . The proportion of patients with long-term remission was not related to the number of initial rituximab applications . No serious side effects were noted . CONCLUSION : Rituximab is an effective treatment option in the short- and long-term control of treatment refractory SSNS . Further controlled studies are needed to address optimal patient selection , dose and safety of rituximab infusions . 	2011	2011-11-15	Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association;2012 May;27;5;1910-5;	Kemper,Markus J,MJ;Gellermann,Jutta,J;Habbig,Sandra,S;Krmar,Rafael T,RT;Dittrich,Katalin,K;Jungraithmayr,Therese,T;Pape,Lars,L;Patzer,Ludwig,L;Billing,Heiko,H;Weber,Lutz,L;Pohl,Martin,M;Rosenthal,Katrin,K;Rosahl,Anne,A;Mueller-Wiefel,Dirk E,DE;D√∂tsch,J√	-1.31463

ERROR 21304109: 22082124	Comparison of nanofiltration efficacy in reducing infectivity of centrifuged versus ultracentrifuged 263K scrapie-infected brain homogenates in &quot; spiked &quot; albumin solutions . 	BACKGROUND : The safety of plasma-derived products is of concern for possible transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease . The absence of validated screening tests requires the use of procedures to remove or inactivate prions during the manufacture of plasma-derived products to minimize the risk of transmission . These procedures need proper validation studies based on spiking human plasma or intermediate fractions of plasma fractionation with prions in a form as close as possible to that present in blood . STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS : Human albumin was spiked with low-speed or high-speed supernatants of 263K scrapie-infected hamster brain homogenates . Spiked albumin was then passed through a cascade of filters from 100 nm down to 20 to 15 nm. Residual infectivity was measured by bioassay . RESULTS : The overall removal of infectivity spiked into albumin through serial nanofiltration steps was 4 to 5 logs using low-speed supernatant and 2 to 3 logs with high-speed supernatant . CONCLUSION : These findings confirm the utility of nanofiltration in removing infectivity from plasma spiked with scrapie brain homogenate supernatants . However , efficiency is diminished using supernatants that have been ultracentrifuged to reduce aggregated forms of the infectious agent . Thus , filtration removal data based on experiments using &quot; standard &quot; low-speed centrifugation supernatants might overestimate the amount of prion removal in plasma or urine-derived therapeutic products . 	2011	2011-11-16	Transfusion;2012 May;52;5;953-62;	Cardone,Franco,F;Simoneau,Steve,S;Arzel,Aude,A;Puopolo,Maria,M;Berardi,Vito Angelo,VA;Abdel-Haq,Hanin,H;Galeno,Roberta,R;De Pascalis,Angela,A;Sbriccoli,Marco,M;Graziano,Silvia,S;Valanzano,Angelina,A;Porte,Pierre,P;Diringer,Heino,H;Brown,Paul,P;Flan,Beno√	-0.807784

Despite the evident roles of TLR2 in intestinal immunity , no study has elucidated the production and cellular source of sTLR2 in IBD . Furthermore , an increase in the population of activated macrophages expressing TLR2 that infiltrates the intestine in IBD has been reported . We aimed first to assess the production of the sTLR2 by UC and CD organ culture biopsies and lamina propria mononuclear cells as well as the levels of sTLR2 in serum , and then characterize the cell population from lamina propria producing the soluble protein . Mucosa explants , LPMCs and serum were obtained from UC , CD patients and control subjects .

Additionally , when characterizing the cellular source of the increased sTLR2 by LPMCs from UC patients , an increase in TLR2 / CD33 cell population was found . Also , these cells expressed CX3CR1 , which was related to the increased levels of intestinal FKN in UC patients , suggesting that a higher proportion of TLR2 mononuclear cells infiltrate the lamina propria .

OBJECTIVES : To assess the frequency of tLTs in IPAH lungs , as compared with control subjects and flow-induced PAH in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome , and to identify local mechanisms responsible for their formation , perpetuation , and function . METHODS : tLT composition and structure were studied by multiple immunostainings . Cytokine / chemokine and growth factor expression was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction and localized by immunofluorescence . The systemic mark of pulmonary lymphoid neogenesis was investigated by flow cytometry analyses of circulating lymphocytes . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : As opposed to lungs from control subjects and patients with Eisenmenger syndrome , IPAH lungs contained perivascular tLTs , comprising B- and T-cell areas with high endothelial venules and dendritic cells . Lymphocyte survival factors , such as IL-7 and platelet-derived growth factor-A , were expressed in tLTs as well as the lymphorganogenic cytokines / chemokines , lymphotoxin-Œ ±/- Œ≤ , CCL19 , CCL20 , CCL21 , and CXCL13 , which might explain the depletion of circulating CCR6 and CXCR5 lymphocytes . tLTs were connected with remodeled vessels via an ER-TR7 stromal network and supplied by lymphatic channels . The presence of germinal center centroblasts , follicular dendritic cells , activation-induced cytidine deaminase , and IL-21PD1 follicular helper T cells in tLTs together with CD138 plasma cell accumulation around remodeled vessels in areas of immunoglobulin deposition argued for local immunoglobulin class switching and ongoing production .

Patients in the telemonitoring group sent , through mobile phones , weight , heart rate , and blood pressure weekly , and capillary plasma lipid profile and glucose monthly . A cardiologist accessed these data through a Web interface and sent recommendations via short message service . Main outcome measures were BP , body mass index , smoking status , low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol , and glycated hemoglobin A‚ÇÅc . RESULTS : At 12-month followup , TMG patients were more likely to experience improvement in cardiovascular risk factors profile than control patients . More TMG patients achieved treatment goals for BP and HbA‚ÇÅc , with no differences in smoking cessation or LDL-c . Body mass index was significantly lower in TMG . CONCLUSIONS : A telemonitoring program , via mobile phone messages , appears to be useful for improving the risk profile in ACS survivors and can be an effective tool for secondary prevention , especially for overweight patients . 	2011	2011-11-25	Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and prevention;2012 Jan-Feb;32;1;25-31;	Blasco,Ana,A;Carmona,Montserrat,M;Fern√°ndez-Lozano,Ignacio,I;Salvador,Carlos H,CH;Pascual,Mario,M;Sagredo,Pilar G,PG;Somolinos,Roberto,R;Mu√±oz,Adolfo,A;Garc√≠a-L√≥pez,Fernando,F;Escudier,Juan M,JM;Mingo,Susana,S;Toquero,Jorge,J;Mo√±ivas,Vanessa,V;Gonz√	-1.65722
ERROR 21339140: 22119095	. 	INTRODUCTION : The number of children of immigrant origin in the last few years has increased the cohort of HIV-infected children in the Community of Madrid . The objectives of the study were to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the new diagnosed children and describe the different subtypes of HIV-1 . PATIENTS AND METHODS : The new diagnosed children were analysed from the year 1997 , divided into 3 periods : P1 , P2 , P3 . The regions and countries of origin , the clinical , immune and viral characteristics , as well as the response to treatment were analysed . The subtypes of HIV-1 were evaluated by phylogenetic analysis of protease genes and reverse transcriptase . RESULTS : We identified 141 new diagnoses of HIV infection , the percentage of immigrant origin in P1 was , P2 and P3 . The origin had changed from Latin America in P1 to sub-Saharan Africa in P3 . There were no differences between Spanish and immigrant children in the age at diagnosis , the CDC clinical stage A / B / C , viral load , percentage of CD4 at diagnosis and actual . Better viral response was more likely in immigrants after the first regimen of HAART independently of the treatment received . A total of 66 subtypes were obtained , 24 % were subtypes non-B . All subtypes of Spanish children and Latin American were subtypes B , and all the children from sub-Saharan Africa were subtypes non-B . CONCLUSION : There were no differences between immigrants and Spanish children infected by HIV , except the different subtypes of HIV-1 . 	2011	2011-11-29	Enfermedades infecciosas y microbiolog√≠a cl√≠nica;2012 Mar;30;3;131-6;	Guill√©n,Sara,S;Prieto,Luis,L;Jim√©nez de Ory,Santiago,S;Gonz√°lez-Granado,Ignacio,I;Gonz√°lez-Tom√©,Mar√≠a Isabel,MI;Mellado,Mar√≠a Jos√©,MJ;de Jos√©,Maribel,M;Navarro,Mar√≠a Luisa,ML;Beceiro,Jos√©,J;Roa,Miguel √Ångel,M√Å;Mu√±oz,Mar√≠a √Ångeles,M√Å;Tom√	-1.2631
ERROR 21347540: 22127935	Improved imaging of lingual articulation using real-time multislice MRI . 	PURPOSE : To develop a real-time imaging technique that allows for simultaneous visualization of vocal tract shaping in multiple scan planes , and provides dynamic visualization of complex articulatory features . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Simultaneous imaging of multiple slices was implemented using a custom real-time imaging platform . Midsagittal , coronal , and axial scan planes of the human upper airway were prescribed and imaged in real-time using a fast spiral gradient-echo pulse sequence . Two native speakers of English produced voiceless and voiced fricatives / f/- / v / , / Œ ∏/- / √∞ / , / s/- / z / , / ‚à ´/- in symmetrical maximally contrastive vocalic contexts / a-a / , / i-i / , and / u-u / . Vocal tract videos were synchronized with noise-cancelled audio recordings , facilitating the selection of frames associated with production of English fricatives . RESULTS : Coronal slices intersecting the postalveolar region of the vocal tract revealed tongue grooving to be most pronounced during fricative production in back vowel contexts , and more pronounced for sibilants / s/- / z / than for / ‚à ´/- . The axial slice best revealed differences in dorsal and pharyngeal articulation ; voiced fricatives were observed to be produced with a larger cross-sectional area in the pharyngeal airway . Partial saturation of spins provided accurate location of imaging planes with respect to each other . CONCLUSION : Real-time MRI of multiple intersecting slices can provide valuable spatial and temporal information about vocal tract shaping , including details not observable from a single slice . 	2011	2011-12-01	Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI;2012 Apr;35;4;943-8;	Kim,Yoon-Chul,YC;Proctor,Michael I,MI;Narayanan,Shrikanth S,SS;Nayak,Krishna S,KS;	-1.1337
ERROR 21359246: 22140254	Minimal tolerance to a tumor antigen encoded by a cancer-germline gene . 	Central tolerance toward tissue-restricted Ags is considered to rely on ectopic expression in the thymus , which was also observed for tumor Ags encoded by cancer-germline genes . It is unknown whether endogenous expression shapes the T cell repertoire against the latter Ags and explains their weak immunogenicity . We addressed this question using mouse cancer-germline gene P1A , which encodes antigenic peptide P1A presented by H-2L . We made P1A-knockout mice and asked whether their anti-P1A immune responses were stronger than those of wild-type mice and whether P1A-KO mice responded to other P1A epitopes , against which wild-type mice were tolerized . We observed that both types of mice mounted similar P1A-specific CD8 T cell responses , although the frequency of P1A-specific CD8 T cells generated in response to P1A-expressing tumors was slightly higher in P1A-KO mice . This higher reactivity allowed naive P1A-KO mice to reject spontaneously P1A-expressing tumors , which progressed in wild-type mice . TCR-VŒ≤ usage of P1A-specific CD8 cells was slightly modified in P1A-KO mice . Peptide P1A remained the only P1A epitope recognized by CD8 T cells in both types of mice , which also displayed similar thymic selection of a transgenic TCR recognizing P1A . These results indicate the existence of a minimal tolerance to an Ag encoded by a cancer-germline gene and suggest that its endogenous expression only slightly affects diversification of the T cell repertoire against this Ag . 	2011	2011-12-06	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);2012 Jan 1;188;1;111-21;	Huijbers,Ivo J,IJ;Soudja,Sa√Ødi M,SM;Uyttenhove,Catherine,C;Buferne,Michel,M;Inderberg-Suso,Else-Marit,EM;Colau,Didier,D;Pilotte,Luc,L;Powis de Tenbossche,C√©line G,CG;Chomez,Patrick,P;Brasseur,Francis,F;Schmitt-Verhulst,Anne-Marie,AM;Van den Eynde,Beno√	-1.16372
ERROR 21378597: 22162058	Role of Ninjurin-1 in the migration of myeloid cells to central nervous system inflammatory lesions . 	OBJECTIVE : Blood-derived myeloid antigen-presenting cells account for a significant proportion of the leukocytes found within lesions of multiple sclerosis and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis . These APCs along with activated microglia are thought to be pivotal in the initiation of the central nervous system -targeted immune response in MS and EAE . However , the exact molecules that direct the migration of myeloid cells from the periphery across the blood-brain barrier remain largely unknown . METHODS : We identified Ninjurin-1 in a proteomic screen of human BBB endothelial cells . We assessed the expression of Ninjurin-1 by BBB-ECs and immune cells , and we determined the role of Ninjurin-1 in immune cell migration to the CNS in vivo in EAE mice . RESULTS : Ninjurin-1 was found to be weakly expressed in the healthy human and mouse CNS but upregulated on BBB-ECs and on infiltrating APCs during the course of EAE and in active MS lesions . In human peripheral blood , Ninjurin-1 was predominantly expressed by monocytes , whereas it was barely detectable on T and B lymphocytes . Moreover , Ninjurin-1 neutralization specifically abrogated the adhesion and migration of human monocytes across BBB-ECs , without affecting lymphocyte recruitment . Finally , Ninjurin-1 blockade reduced clinical disease activity and histopathological indices of EAE and decreased infiltration of macrophages , dendritic cells , and APCs into the CNS . INTERPRETATION : Our study uncovers an important cell-specific role for Ninjurin-1 in the transmigration of inflammatory APCs across the BBB and further emphasizes the importance of myeloid cell recruitment during the development of neuroinflammatory lesions . 	2011	2011-12-14	Annals of neurology;2011 Nov;70;5;751-63;	Ifergan,Igal,I;Kebir,Hania,H;Terouz,Simone,S;Alvarez,Jorge I,JI;L√©cuyer,Marc-Andr√©,MA;Gendron,Steve,S;Bourbonni√®re,Lyne,L;Dunay,Ildiko R,IR;Bouthillier,Alain,A;Moumdjian,Robert,R;Fontana,Adriano,A;Haqqani,Arsalan,A;Klopstein,Armelle,A;Prinz,Marco,M;L√	-0.904377
ERROR 21383835: 22167411	Mitotic checkpoints and chromosome instability are strong predictors of clinical outcome in gastrointestinal stromal tumors . 	PURPOSE : The importance of KIT and PDGFRA mutations in the oncogenesis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors is well established , but the genetic basis of GIST metastasis is poorly understood . We recently published a 67 gene expression prognostic signature related to genome complexity and asked whether it could predict outcome in GISTs . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN : We carried out genome and expression profiling on 67 primary untreated GISTs . RESULTS : We show and validate here that it can predict metastasis in a new data set of 67 primary untreated GISTs . The gene whose expression was most strongly associated with metastasis was AURKA , but the AURKA locus was not amplified . Instead , we identified deletion of the p16 and retinoblastoma genes as likely causal events leading to increased AURKA and CINSARC gene expression , to chromosome rearrangement , and ultimately to metastasis . On the basis of these findings , we established a Genomic Index that integrates the number and type of DNA copy number alterations . This index is a strong prognostic factor in GISTs . We show that CINSARC class , AURKA expression , and Genomic Index all outperform the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology grading system in determining the prognosis of patients with GISTs . Interestingly , these signatures can identify poor prognosis patients in the group classified as intermediate-risk by the AFIP classification . CONCLUSIONS : We propose that a high Genomic Index determined by comparative genomic hybridization from formalin-fixed , paraffin-embedded samples could be used to identify AFIP intermediate-risk patients who would benefit from imatinib therapy . 	2011	2011-12-15	Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research;2012 Feb 1;18;3;826-38;	Lagarde,Pauline,P;P√©rot,Ga√´lle,G;Kauffmann,Audrey,A;Brulard,C√©line,C;Dapremont,Val√©rie,V;Hostein,Isabelle,I;Neuville,Agn√®s,A;Wozniak,Agnieszka,A;Sciot,Raf,R;Sch√∂ffski,Patrick,P;Aurias,Alain,A;Coindre,Jean-Michel,JM;Debiec-Rychter,Maria,M;Chibon,Fr√	-0.799292
ERROR 21388341: 22172242	Comparison of late results of percutaneous coronary intervention among stable patients ‚â§65 versus &gt; 65 years of age with an occluded infarct related artery . 	Although opening an occluded infarct-related artery &gt; 24 hours after myocardial infarction in stable patients in the Occluded Artery Trial did not reduce events over 7 years , there was a suggestion that the effect of treatment might differ by patient age . Baseline characteristics and outcomes by treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy alone were compared by prespecified stratification at age 65 years . A p value &lt; 0.01 was prespecified as significant for OAT secondary analyses . The primary outcome was death , myocardial infarction , or New York Heart Association class IV heart failure . Patients aged &gt; 65 years were more likely to be female , to be nonsmokers , and to have hypertension , lower estimated glomerular filtration rates , and multivessel disease compared to younger patients . There was no significant observed interaction between treatment assignment and age for the primary outcome after adjustment , and there was no difference between PCI and optimal medical therapy observed in either age group . At 7-year follow-up , younger patients tended to have angina more often compared to the older group . The 7-year composite primary outcome was more common in older patients , and age remained significant after covariate adjustment . The rate of early PCI complications was low in the 2 age groups . The trend toward a differential effect of PCI in the young versus the old for the primary outcome was likely driven by measured and unmeasured confounders and by chance . PCI reduces angina to a similar degree in the young and old . In conclusion , there is no indication for routine PCI to open a persistently occluded infarct-related artery in stable patients after myocardial infarction , regardless of age . 	2011	2011-12-17	The American journal of cardiology;2012 Mar 1;109;5;614-9;	Skolnick,Adam H,AH;Reynolds,Harmony R,HR;White,Harvey D,HD;Menon,Venu,V;Carvalho,Antonio C,AC;Maggioni,Aldo P,AP;Pearte,Camille A,CA;Gruberg,Luis,L;Azevedo,Rudyney E U,RE;Schroeder,Erwin,E;Forman,Sandra A,SA;Lamas,Gervasio A,GA;Hochman,Judith S,JS;D≈æav√	-1.0421
ERROR 21389234: 22173152	Twenty-year protocol liver biopsies : Invasive but useful for the management of liver recipients . 	BACKGROUND &amp; # 38 ; AIMS : Most liver transplant centres have discontinued the practice of protocol liver biopsies , mainly because of the perceived lack of therapeutic benefit . This study aimed to examine the usefulness of 20-year LBs . METHODS : Ten , 15 , and 20-year protocol LBs from 147 patients surviving for &gt; 20 years were reviewed . Twenty-year biopsy findings were correlated with clinical data . RESULTS : Twenty-year-biopsy patients and 20-year-non-biopsy patients were similar in terms of transplant data , adverse events , and liver function tests . Twenty-year LBs revealed a 90 % prevalence of abnormalities , among which viral chronic hepatitis was the most common . Between 15 and 20 years , hepatic structural abnormalities were the only disorder to increase . An individual progression of abnormalities occurred in 56 % of patients . At 20 years , the negative and positive predictive values of LFTs with respect to histological abnormalities were 95 % and 18 % , respectively ; in VCH , Fibrotest and transient elastography displayed poor discriminative ability for fibrosis , but were satisfactory regarding significant fibrosis . A decrease in immunosuppression was less frequent while an increase was more common in 20-year-biopsy patients than in non-biopsy patients . Antiviral therapy was administered in seven of the 20-year biopsy patients , but in none of the non-biopsy patients . CONCLUSIONS : Twenty-year LBs provided important histological information on graft function that was available to a limited degree from LFTs and non-invasive markers . They exerted an impact on immunosuppressive and antiviral therapies . 	2011	2011-12-17	Journal of hepatology;2012 Apr;56;4;840-7;	Sebagh,Myl√®ne,M;Samuel,Didier,D;Antonini,Teresa Maria,TM;Coilly,Audrey,A;Degli Esposti,Davide,D;Roche,Bruno,B;Karam,Vincent,V;Dos Santos,Alexandre,A;Duclos-Vall√©e,Jean-Charles,JC;Roque-Afonso,Anne-Marie,AM;Ballot,Eric,E;Guettier,Catherine,C;Blandin,Fr√	-1.47686
ERROR 21394786: 22179083	Blood pressure and other metabolic syndrome factors and risk of brain tumour in the large population-based Me-Can cohort study . 	OBJECTIVES : Brain tumour has few established determinants . We assessed to which extent risk of brain tumour was related to metabolic syndrome factors in adults . METHODS : In the Me-Can project , 580‚Ää000 individuals from Sweden , Austria , and Norway were followed for a median of 10 years after baseline measurement . Data on brain tumours were obtained from national cancer registries . The factors of metabolic syndrome , separately and combined , were analysed in quintiles and for transformed z-scores . Cox proportional hazards multivariate regression models were used , with corrections for measurement error . RESULTS : During follow-up , 1312 primary brain tumours were diagnosed , predominantly meningioma and high-grade glioma . For meningioma , the hazard ratio was increased for z-scores of SBP , of DBP , and of the combined metabolic syndrome score . An increased risk of high-grade glioma was found for DBP and triglycerides . For both meningioma and high-grade glioma , the risk was more than double in the fifth quintiles of DBP compared to the lowest quintile . For meningioma this risk was even larger for SBP . CONCLUSION : Increased blood pressure was associated with risk of brain tumours , especially of meningiomas . 	2011	2011-12-20	Journal of hypertension;2012 Feb;30;2;290-6;	Edlinger,Michael,M;Strohmaier,Susanne,S;Jonsson,H√•kan,H;Bj√∏rge,Tone,T;Manjer,Jonas,J;Borena,Wegene T,WT;H√§ggstr√∂m,Christel,C;Engeland,Anders,A;Tretli,Steinar,S;Concin,Hans,H;Nagel,Gabriele,G;Selmer,Randi,R;Johansen,Dorthe,D;Stocks,Tanja,T;Hallmans,G√	-1.15104

OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the relationship between FAST peak percentage by adapted Bio-Rad Vnbs analysis using the valley-to-valley integration and genotypes with the aim to improve differentiation between severe Œ±-thalassaemia forms and the milder disease types . METHOD : DNA analysis for Œ±-thalassaemia was performed on 91 dried blood spot samples presenting normal and elevated FAST peak levels , selected during three years of Dutch national newborn screening . RESULTS : Significant differences were found between samples with and without Œ±-thalassaemia mutations , regardless of the genetic profiles . No significant difference was demonstrated between HPLC in -Œ± / Œ±Œ± and -Œ ±/- Œ± , between -Œ ±/- Œ± and - - / Œ±Œ± and between - - / Œ±Œ± and - -/- Œ± genotypes . CONCLUSION : This study confirms that the percentage HbBart &apos; s , as depicted by the FAST peak , is only a relative indication for the number of Œ± genes affected in Œ±-thalassaemia .

Then , we assessed UA redox properties against different reactive species generated in vitro , and evaluated its action on SH-SY5Y neuronal like cells upon hydrogen peroxide , since no in vitro neurotoxicological data has been reported so far . Total reactive antioxidant potential index showed a significant antioxidant capacity of UA at the highest tested concentration ; UA was also effective against hydroxyl radicals and reduced the formation of nitric oxide . In vitro , lipoperoxidation was enhanced by UA and changed the cellular viability at highest concentration of 20Œºg / mL for 1 and 4h , as well as 2 and 20Œºg / mL for 24h of treatment , according to MTT reduction assay . Moreover , UA did not display protective effects against HO-induced cell death in any case .

ERROR 21415430: 22200994	Mutation screening of 75 candidate genes in 152 complex I deficiency cases identifies pathogenic variants in 16 genes including NDUFB9 . 	BACKGROUND : Mitochondrial complex I deficiency is the most common cause of mitochondrial disease in childhood . Identification of the molecular basis is difficult given the clinical and genetic heterogeneity . Most patients lack a molecular definition in routine diagnostics . METHODS : A large-scale mutation screen of 75 candidate genes in 152 patients with complex I deficiency was performed by high-resolution melting curve analysis and Sanger sequencing . The causal role of a new disease allele was confirmed by functional complementation assays . The clinical phenotype of patients carrying mutations was documented using a standardised questionnaire . RESULTS : Causative mutations were detected in 16 genes , 15 of which had previously been associated with complex I deficiency : three mitochondrial DNA genes encoding complex I subunits , two mitochondrial tRNA genes and nuclear DNA genes encoding six complex I subunits and four assembly factors . For the first time , a causal mutation is described in NDUFB9 , coding for a complex I subunit , resulting in reduction in NDUFB9 protein and both amount and activity of complex I . These features were rescued by expression of wild-type NDUFB9 in patient-derived fibroblasts . CONCLUSION : Mutant NDUFB9 is a new cause of complex I deficiency . A molecular diagnosis related to complex I deficiency was established in 18 % of patients . However , most patients are likely to carry mutations in genes so far not associated with complex I function . The authors conclude that the high degree of genetic heterogeneity in complex I disorders warrants the implementation of unbiased genome-wide strategies for the complete molecular dissection of mitochondrial complex I deficiency . 	2011	2011-12-28	Journal of medical genetics;2012 Feb;49;2;83-9;	Haack,Tobias B,TB;Madignier,Florence,F;Herzer,Martina,M;Lamantea,Eleonora,E;Danhauser,Katharina,K;Invernizzi,Federica,F;Koch,Johannes,J;Freitag,Martin,M;Drost,Rene,R;Hillier,Ingo,I;Haberberger,Birgit,B;Mayr,Johannes A,JA;Ahting,Uwe,U;Tiranti,Valeria,V;R√	-0.62244

BACKGROUND : Clinical and epidemiological data of pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection in solid-organ transplant recipients have been described , but scarce data compare these outcomes with nonimmunocompromised patients . METHODS : We retrospectively reviewed and compared the clinical presentation , morbidity , and mortality of all kidney transplant and nonimmunocompromised patients admitted for at least 12 hr with a diagnosis of pandemic influenza A H1N1 infection in a single hospital complex during the 2009 pandemic . RESULTS : There were 22 patients in the KT group and 53 in the non-KT group . The prevalence of diabetes was higher in KT group while chronic pulmonary disease was more frequent in non-KT group . Clinical and radiological presentations and duration of disease were similar between the two groups . The incidence of acute renal failure was higher among KT patients . No differences in the rate of intensive care unit admission or hospital mortality were observed . For the overall population , poor outcome , defined as intensive care unit admission or death , was associated with in-hospital acquisition , symptom onset more than 48 hr , and acute renal failure .

OBJECTIVES : MHCIITA is a major regulator of MHC expression that has been reported to be involved in the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis and myocardial infarction . In this study we investigated the potential association of two MHCIITA gene polymorphisms with cardiovascular risk in patients with RA . METHODS : 1302 patients fulfilling the 1987 ACR classification criteria for RA were genotyped for the MHCIITA rs3087456 and rs4774 gene polymorphisms to determine the influence of MHCIITA variants in the development of CV events . The potential influence of these polymorphisms in the development of subclinical atherosclerosis was also analysed in a subgroup of patients with no history of CV events by the assessment of two surrogate markers of atherosclerosis ; brachial and carotid ultrasonography to determine endothelial function and carotid artery intima-media thickness , respectively . RESULTS : No statistically significant differences in the allele or genotype frequencies for each individual MHCIITA gene polymorphism between RA patients who experienced CV events , or not , were found . This was also the case when each polymorphism was assessed according to results obtained from surrogate markers of atherosclerosis . Also , in assessing the combined influence of both MHCIITA gene polymorphisms in the risk of CV disease after adjustment for gender , age at time of disease diagnosis , follow-up time , traditional CV risk factors , and shared epitope status , patients with CV events only showed a marginally decreased frequency of the MHCIITA rs3087456-rs4774 G-G allele combination .

Plant sterols such as sitosterol and campesterol are frequently administered as cholesterol-lowering supplements in food . Recently , it has been shown in mice that , in contrast to the structurally related cholesterol , circulating plant sterols can enter the brain . We questioned whether the accumulation of plant sterols in murine brain is reversible . After being fed a plant sterol ester-enriched diet for 6 weeks , C57BL / 6NCrl mice displayed significantly increased concentrations of plant sterols in serum , liver , and brain by 2- to 3-fold . Blocking intestinal sterol uptake for the next 6 months while feeding the mice with a plant stanol ester-enriched diet resulted in strongly decreased plant sterol levels in serum and liver , without affecting brain plant sterol levels . Relative to plasma concentrations , brain levels of campesterol were higher than sitosterol , suggesting that campesterol traverses the blood-brain barrier more efficiently . In vitro experiments with brain endothelial cell cultures showed that campesterol crossed the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than sitosterol . We conclude that , over a 6-month period , plant sterol accumulation in murine brain is virtually irreversible . 	2012	2012-01-27	Journal of lipid research;2012 Apr;53;4;726-35;	Vanmierlo,Tim,T;Weing√§rtner,Oliver,O;van der Pol,Susanne,S;Husche,Constanze,C;Kerksiek,Anja,A;Friedrichs,Silvia,S;Sijbrands,Eric,E;Steinbusch,Harry,H;Grimm,Marcus,M;Hartmann,Tobias,T;Laufs,Ulrich,U;B√∂hm,Michael,M;de Vries,Helga E,HE;Mulder,Monique,M;L√	-1.31235
ERROR 21494617: 22286395	Expression and characterization of natural-like recombinant Der p 2 for sublingual immunotherapy . 	BACKGROUND : Recombinant allergens with a native conformation represent an alternative to natural extracts for immunotherapy and diagnostic purposes . METHODS : We produced the Der p 2 mite allergen in Pichia pastoris and Escherichia coli . After purification by cation exchange chromatography , recombinant molecules were compared to their natural counterpart based upon structural and immunological properties . RESULTS : The Der p 2.0101 isoform was confirmed to be prevalent in Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus extracts . It was then produced as a secreted molecule in P. pastoris or refolded from E. coli inclusion bodies . The yeast-expressed rDer p 2 molecule exhibits a natural-like disulfide bridge distribution and secondary structure , whereas the E. coli-derived rDer p 2 presents some heterogeneity in cysteine bonds and a lower stability following thermal stress . The two recombinant as well as natural Der p 2 molecules exhibit comparable IgE recognition and activate basophil and CD4+ T cells . Sublingual immunotherapy of nDer p 2- sensitized mice using either one of the rDer p 2 molecules efficiently decreases airway hyperresponsiveness as well as Th2 responses . CONCLUSIONS : Natural and recombinant Der p 2 molecules produced in P. pastoris and E. coli exhibit comparable immunological properties despite distinct structural features . Natural-like cysteine pairing is a critical parameter to identify stable , well-folded and homogenous proteins appropriate for immunotherapy and diagnostic purposes . 	2012	2012-01-31	International archives of allergy and immunology;2012;158;2;157-67;	Bordas-Le Floch,V√©ronique,V;Bussi√®res,Laetitia,L;Airouche,Sabi,S;Lautrette,Aur√©lie,A;Bouley,Julien,J;Berjont,Nathalie,N;Horiot,St√©phane,S;Huet,Axelle,A;Jain,Karine,K;Lemoine,Pierrick,P;Chabre,Henri,H;Batard,Thierry,T;Mascarell,Laurent,L;Baron-Bodo,V√	-0.838992
ERROR 21502531: 22294627	Association between genetic variants in the tumour necrosis factor / lymphotoxin Œ± / lymphotoxin Œ≤ locus and primary Sjogren &apos; s syndrome in Scandinavian samples . 	OBJECTIVES : Lymphotoxin Œ≤ has been found to be upregulated in salivary glands of patients with primary Sj√∂gren &apos; s syndrome . An animal model of pSS also showed ablation of the lymphoid organisation and a marked improvement in salivary gland function on blocking the LTB receptor pathway . This study aimed to investigate whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the lymphotoxin Œ± / LTB / tumour necrosis factor gene clusters are associated with pSS . METHODS : 527 pSS patients and 532 controls participated in the study , all of Caucasian origin from Sweden and Norway . 14 SNP markers were genotyped and after quality control filtering , 12 SNP were analysed for their association with pSS using single marker and haplotype tests , and corrected by permutation testing . RESULTS : Nine markers showed significant association with pSS at the p=0.05 level . Markers rs1800629 and rs909253 showed the strongest genotype association . When the analysis was conditioned for the effect of rs1800629 , only the association with rs909253 remained nominally significant . In haplotype analyses the strongest effect was observed for the haplotype rs909253G-rs1800629A . The associations were mainly due to anti-Ro / SSA and anti-La / SSB antibody-positive pSS . CONCLUSIONS : A strong association was found between several SNP in the LTA / LTB / TNFŒ± locus and pSS , some of which led to amino acid changes . These data suggest a role for this locus in the development of pSS . Further studies are needed to examine if the genetic effect described here is independent of the known genetic association between HLA and pSS . 	2012	2012-02-02	Annals of the rheumatic diseases;2012 Jun;71;6;981-8;	Bolstad,Anne Isine,AI;Le Hellard,Stephanie,S;Kristjansdottir,Gudlaug,G;Vasaitis,Lilian,L;Kvarnstr√∂m,Marika,M;Sj√∂wall,Christopher,C;Johnsen,Svein Joar Augl√¶nd,SJ;Eriksson,Per,P;Omdal,Roald,R;Brun,Johan G,JG;Wahren-Herlenius,Marie,M;Theander,Elke,E;Syv√	-1.09353
ERROR 21513242: 22305819	Renal insufficiency and vascular complications after primary angioplasty via femoral route . Impact of vascular closure devices use . 	INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES : We sought to determine the incidence of vascular complications in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing primary angioplasty via the femoral route ; we also evaluated the safety and efficacy of the use of vascular closure devices in this setting . METHODS : Registry of 527 patients undergoing primary angioplasty via the femoral route from January 2003 to December 2008 . Chronic kidney disease was defined as creatinine clearance less than 60 mL / min. The primary endpoint was the presence of major vascular complications . RESULTS : Baseline chronic kidney disease was observed in 166 patients . Patients with chronic kidney disease experienced higher rates of major vascular complications compared to those without worsening of renal function , especially those requiring transfusion . Among patients with chronic kidney disease , 129 received a vascular closure device and manual compression was used in 37 patients . The risk of major vascular complications was significantly lower with vascular closure device use compared to manual compression . Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the use of a vascular closure device was independently associated with a decreased risk of major vascular complications in patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing primary angioplasty . CONCLUSIONS : Patients with chronic kidney disease undergoing primary angioplasty via the femoral route experience higher rates of major vascular complications . The use of vascular closure devices in this group of patients is safe and is associated with lower rates of major vascular complications compared to manual compression . 	2012	2012-02-07	Revista espa√±ola de cardiolog√≠a;2012 Mar;65;3;258-64;	Prada-Delgado,Oscar,O;Est√©vez-Loureiro,Rodrigo,R;Calvi√±o-Santos,Ram√≥n,R;Barge-Caballero,Eduardo,E;Salgado-Fern√°ndez,Jorge,J;Pi√±√≥n-Esteban,Pablo,P;V√°zquez-Rodr√≠guez,Jos√© Manuel,JM;Aldama-L√≥pez,Guillermo,G;Flores-R√≠os,Xacobe,X;Soler-Mart√≠n,Mar√	-1.26416
ERROR 21514956: 22307608	Brush border myosin Ia has tumor suppressor activity in the intestine . 	The loss of the epithelial architecture and cell polarity / differentiation is known to be important during the tumorigenic process . Here we demonstrate that the brush border protein Myosin Ia is important for polarization and differentiation of colon cancer cells and is frequently inactivated in colorectal tumors by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms . MYO1A frame-shift mutations were observed in 32 % of the colorectal tumors with microsatellite instability analyzed , and evidence of promoter methylation was observed in a significant proportion of colon cancer cell lines and primary colorectal tumors . The loss of polarization / differentiation resulting from MYO1A inactivation is associated with higher tumor growth in soft agar and in a xenograft model . In addition , the progression of genetically and carcinogen-initiated intestinal tumors was significantly accelerated in Myo1a knockout mice compared with Myo1a wild-type animals . Moreover , MYO1A tumor expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for colorectal cancer patients . Patients with low MYO1A tumor protein levels had significantly shorter disease-free and overall survival compared with patients with high tumoral MYO1A . The median time-to-disease recurrence in patients with low MYO1A was 1 y , compared with &gt; 9 y in the group of patients with high MYO1A . These results identify MYO1A as a unique tumor-suppressor gene in colorectal cancer and demonstrate that the loss of structural brush border proteins involved in cell polarity are important for tumor development . 	2012	2012-02-07	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America;2012 Jan 31;109;5;1530-5;	Mazzolini,Rocco,R;Dopeso,Higinio,H;Mateo-Lozano,Silvia,S;Chang,Wakam,W;Rodrigues,Paulo,P;Bazzocco,Sarah,S;Alazzouzi,Hafid,H;Landolfi,Stefania,S;Hern√°ndez-Losa,Javier,J;Andretta,Elena,E;Alhopuro,Pia,P;Esp√≠n,Eloy,E;Armengol,Manel,M;Tabernero,Josep,J;Ram√	-0.929033
ERROR 21515799: 22308475	Functional evidence that a recently evolved Drosophila sperm-specific gene boosts sperm competition . 	In many species , both morphological and molecular traits related to sex and reproduction evolve faster in males than in females . Ultimately , rapid male evolution relies on the acquisition of genetic variation associated with differential reproductive success . Many newly evolved genes are associated with novel functions that might enhance male fitness . However , functional evidence of the adaptive role of recently originated genes in males is still lacking . The Sperm dynein intermediate chain multigene family , which encodes a Sperm dynein intermediate chain presumably involved in sperm motility , originated from complex genetic rearrangements in the lineage that leads to Drosophila melanogaster within the last 5.4 million years since its split from Drosophila simulans . We deleted all the members of this multigene family resident on the X chromosome of D. melanogaster by chromosome engineering and found that , although the deletion does not result in a reduction of progeny number , it impairs the competence of the sperm in the presence of sperm from wild-type males . Therefore , the Sperm dynein intermediate chain multigene family contributes to the differential reproductive success among males and illustrates precisely how quickly a new gene function can be incorporated into the genetic network of a species . 	2012	2012-02-07	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America;2012 Feb 7;109;6;2043-8;	Yeh,Shu-Dan,SD;Do,Tiffanie,T;Chan,Carolus,C;Cordova,Adriana,A;Carranza,Francisco,F;Yamamoto,Eugene A,EA;Abbassi,Mashya,M;Gandasetiawan,Kania A,KA;Librado,Pablo,P;Damia,Elisabetta,E;Dimitri,Patrizio,P;Rozas,Julio,J;Hartl,Daniel L,DL;Roote,John,J;Ranz,Jos√	-0.897962
ERROR 21517299: 22310041	Incidence trends of traumatic spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury in Spain , 2000-2009 . 	AIMS : The aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of hospital discharges for traumatic spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury in Spain by injury circumstances , injury severity , gender and age group and to describe its trends over the period 2000-2009 . METHODS : It is a study of trends that includes hospital discharges with a primary diagnosis of TSCI or TBI . Crude and age-standardised rates were calculated per million inhabitants . Changes in rates between 2000 and 2009 were assessed through calculation of the relative risk adjusted for age , using Poisson regression . RESULTS : Between 2000 and 2009 in Spain , 10,274 patients were admitted for traumatic TSCI , and 206,503 for TBI . The annual incidence rate for TSCI was 23.5 per million , that for TBI was 472.6 per million . The overall incidence rate for TSCI fell significantly between 2000 and 2009 by 24.2 % , as did that for TBI . Among people aged 65 years and over , no change was observed for TSCI , incidence of TBI fell significantly when due to traffic crashes , but there was a dramatic increase of 87 % in men and 89.3 % in women when due to other circumstances . CONCLUSIONS : Over the last decade the incidence of these types of injury has fallen significantly when the injury resulted from traffic crashes , and to a lesser extent when from other circumstances . However TBI incidence among people aged 65 and over injured in non-traffic-related circumstances has risen dramatically . 	2012	2012-02-09	Accident; analysis and prevention;2012 May;46;;37-44;	P√©rez,Katherine,K;Novoa,Ana M,AM;Santamari√±a-Rubio,Elena,E;Narvaez,Yislenz,Y;Arrufat,Vita,V;Borrell,Carme,C;Cabeza,Elena,E;Cirera,Eva,E;Ferrando,Josep,J;Garc√≠a-Alt√©s,Anna,A;Gonzalez-Luque,Juan Carlos,JC;Lizarbe,Vicenta,V;Martin-Cantera,Carlos,C;Segu√	-1.32788

We performed spoligotyping and 12-mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeats typing to characterise Mycobacterium bovis isolates collected from tissue samples of bovines with lesions suggestive for tuberculosis during slaughter inspection procedures in abattoirs in Brazil . High-quality genotypes were obtained with both procedures for 61 isolates that were obtained from 185 bovine tissue samples and all of these isolates were identified as M. bovis by conventional identification procedures . On the basis of the spoligotyping , 53 isolates were grouped into nine clusters and the remaining eight isolates were unique types , resulting in 17 spoligotypes . The majority of the Brazilian M. bovis isolates displayed spoligotype patterns that have been previously observed in strains isolated from cattle in other countries . MIRU-VNTR typing produced 16 distinct genotypes , with 53 isolates forming eight of the groups , and individual isolates with unique VNTR profiles forming the remaining eight groups . The allelic diversity of each VNTR locus was calculated and only two of the 12-MIRU-VNTR loci presented scores with either a moderate or high discriminatory index . Both typing methods produced similar discriminatory indexes and the combination of the two methods increased the h value to 0.94 , resulting in 29 distinct patterns . These results confirm that spoligotyping and VNTR analysis are valuable tools for studying the molecular epidemiology of M. bovis infections in Brazil . 	2012	2012-02-09	Mem√≥rias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz;2012 Feb;107;1;64-73;	Parreiras,Patr√≠cia Martins,PM;Andrade,Giovanna Ivo,GI;Nascimento,Telma de Figueiredo do,Tde F;Oelemann,Maran√≠bia Cardoso,MC;Gomes,Harrison Magdinier,HM;Alencar,Andrea Padilha de,AP;Assis,Ronnie Antunes de,RA;Mota,Pedro Moacyr Pinto Coelho,PM;Pereira,M√	-1.15014
ERROR 21539121: 22334260	Modulation of regulatory T-cell activity in combination with interleukin-12 increases hepatic tolerogenicity in woodchucks with chronic hepatitis B . 	Regulatory T cells play a critical role in the modulation of immune responses to viral antigens in chronic viral hepatitis . Woodchucks infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus represent the best animal model for chronic hepatitis B virus infection . Examination of intrahepatic and peripheral Treg in uninfected and WHV chronically infected woodchucks showed a significant increase of intrahepatic Treg numbers in chronically infected animals , whereas no differences were found in peripheral blood . In agreement with these data , higher expression levels of Forkhead box P3 , interleukin -10 , transforming growth factor beta were detected in the liver of chronic WHV carriers in comparison to uninfected animals . Furthermore , treatment of WHV-infected animals with an adenovirus encoding IL-12 failed to reduce viral load , a finding that was associated with lymphocyte unresponsiveness to IL-12 stimulation in vitro . We observed that TGF-Œ≤ and Treg play a major role in the lack of lymphocyte response to IL-12 stimulation , as TGF-Œ≤ inhibition and Treg depletion allowed recovery of T-cell responsiveness to this cytokine . Based on these results , woodchucks were treated with IL-12 in combination with a TGF-Œ≤ inhibitory peptide or Treg depletion . However , no antiviral effect was achieved and , instead , an enhancement of the intrahepatic tolerogenic environment was observed . CONCLUSION : Our data show that TGF-Œ≤ inhibition or Treg depletion had no added benefit over IL-12 therapy in chronic WHV infection . IL-12 immunostimulation induces a strong immunosuppressive reaction in the liver of chronic WHV carriers that counteracts the antiviral effect of the treatment . 	2012	2012-02-16	Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.);2012 Aug;56;2;474-83;	Otano,Itziar,I;Suarez,Lester,L;Dotor,Javier,J;Gonzalez-Aparicio,Manuela,M;Crettaz,Julien,J;Olag√ºe,Cristina,C;Vales,Africal,A;Riezu,Jose Ignacio,JI;Larrea,Esther,E;Borras,Francisco,F;Benito,Alberto,A;Hernandez-Alcoceba,Ruben,R;Menne,Stephan,S;Prieto,Jes√	-0.816823

RESULTS : Of the 2000 procedures , 30 % were done at general hospitals , 20 % at university hospitals , and 50 % in private practices . The colonoscopies were carried out for a valid indication for 95.9 % . Colon preparation was insufficient in 3.7 % . Colonoscopies were successful in 95.3 % . Adenoma detection rate was 0.31 in successful colonoscopies . CONCLUSION : This tool for evaluating the quality of colonoscopy procedures in healthcare units is based on standard endoscopy and patient criteria . It is an easy and feasible procedure giving the ability to detect suboptimal practice and differences between endoscopy-units . It will enable individual units to assess the quality of their colonoscopy techniques . 	2012	2012-04-18	PloS one;2012;7;4;e33957;	Coriat,Romain,R;Lecler,Augustin,A;Lamarque,Dominique,D;Deyra,Jacques,J;Roche,Herv√©,H;Nizou,Catherine,C;Berretta,Olivier,O;Mesnard,Bruno,B;Bouygues,Martin,M;Soupison,Alain,A;Monnin,Jean-Luc,JL;Podevin,Philippe,P;Cassaz,Carole,C;Sautereau,Denis,D;Prat,Fr√	-1.22866
ERROR 21704606: 22510353	Liver toxicity of initial antiretroviral drug regimens including two nucleoside analogs plus one non-nucleoside analog or one ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in HIV / HCV-coinfected patients . 	OBJECTIVE : To evaluate the incidence and risk factors for grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST elevations and grade 4 total bilirubin elevations among HIV / HCV- coinfected treatment-na√Øve patients with an initial regimen including 2 nucleoside analogs plus efavirenz , nevirapine , or a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor . PATIENTS AND METHODS : This was a retrospective multicenter observational cohort study that recruited 745 HIV-infected drug-na√Øve patients with detectable plasma HCV RNA who started a regimen including EFV , NVP , or PI / r . RESULTS : EFV was prescribed in 323 , NVP in 126 , and a PI / r in 296 patients . Grade 3 or 4 TE were observed in 19 individuals receiving EFV compared with 14 on NVP and 31 on PI / r . Grade 4 TBE were identified in 7 patients on EFV , 1 on NVP , and 11 on PI / r . Therapy was discontinued due to liver toxicity in 13 patients on EFV , 16 on NVP , and 17 on PI / r . CONCLUSIONS : Regimens including EFV , NVP , or PI / r are generally safe in treatment-na√Øve HIV / HCV-coinfected patients . Grade 3-4 TE are less commonly seen with EFV than with PI / r . Discontinuations due to hepatotoxicity were less frequent for patients receiving EFV than for those treated with NVP . 	2012	2012-04-19	HIV clinical trials;2012 Mar-Apr;13;2;61-9;	Mac√≠as,Juan,J;Neukam,Karin,K;Mallolas,Josep,J;L√≥pez-Cort√©s,Luis F,LF;Cart√≥n,Jos√© A,JA;Domingo,Pere,P;Moreno,Santiago,S;Iribarren,Jos√© A,JA;Clotet,Bonaventura,B;Crespo,Manell,M;de Los Santos,Ignacio,I;Ortega,Enrique,E;Knobel,Hernando,H;Jim√©nez-Exp√	-1.08548

The serum IgG , IgM , IgA , and fecal IgA antibody levels were evaluated by using the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay . Some animals produced antibody levels beyond cut-off ; however , two animals from G1 and three from G3 demonstrated IgG levels on being challenged , with similar results occurring in two cats from G1 to IgM . Fecal IgA levels were detected in all G1 cats , and in one cat from G3 . The serum and fecal humoral immune responses did not correlate with oocyst shedding . Oocyst shedding varied from 98.4 % , 87.5 % , 53.0 % , to 58 % , and was lower than that of G5 cats . The prepatent period of cats vaccinated intranasally was reduced from 6-9.6 to 2.8 days , suggesting protection of environmental contamination , considering cats as the primary source of contamination .

BLEO-PF was induced with a single intratracheal dose of bleomycin . Twenty-one days after bleomycin administration , the mortality rate was over 50 % in C57BL / 6 and 20 % in DBA / 2 mice , and BLEO-PF was not observed in BALB / c . There was an increase in lung static elastance , viscoelastic / inhomogeneous pressure , total pressure drop after flow interruption , and ŒîE in C57BL / 6 mice . The septa volume increased in C57BL / 6 and DBA / 2 . The levels of IFN-Œ≥ were reduced in C57BL / 6 mice . OH-proline levels were increased in C57BL / 6 and DBA / 2 mice .

Recently , Solomon et al. observed an increased prevalence of component features among first-degree relatives of VATER / VACTERL patients suggesting that in some patients , the disorder may be inherited . To replicate these findings , we investigated 87 VATER / VACTERL patients with the presence of a minimum of three component features and their first-degree relatives . No increase in the overall prevalence of component features was observed in first-degree relatives compared to the general population . Separate analysis for the prevalence of single component features showed a higher prevalence of tracheoesophageal fistula / atresia among first-degree relatives compared to the general population . However , this was based on occurrence in one family only . Our findings suggest that although familial occurrence renders a genetic contribution likely , the overall risk of recurrence among the first-degree relatives of patients with VATER / VACTERL association is probably very low .

BACKGROUND : Mild traumatic brain injury is a major public-health concern and represents 70-90 % of all treated traumatic brain injuries . The last best-evidence synthesis , conducted by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Neurotrauma , Prevention , Management and Rehabilitation in 2002 , found few quality studies on prognosis . The objective of this review is to update these findings . Specifically , we aim to describe the course , identify modifiable prognostic factors , determine long-term sequelae , and identify effects of interventions for MTBI . Finally , we will identify gaps in the literature , and make recommendations for future research . METHODS : The databases MEDLINE , PsychINFO , Embase , CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were systematically searched . The search terms included &apos; traumatic brain injury &apos; , &apos; craniocerebral trauma &apos; , &apos; prognosis &apos; , and &apos; recovery of function &apos; . Reference lists of eligible papers were also searched . Studies were screened according to pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria . Inclusion criteria included original , published peer-reviewed research reports in English , French , Swedish , Norwegian , Danish and Spanish , and human participants of all ages with an accepted definition of MTBI . Exclusion criteria included publication types other than systematic reviews , meta-analyses , randomized controlled trials , cohort studies , and case-control studies ; as well as cadaveric , biomechanical , and laboratory studies . All eligible papers were critically appraised using a modification of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network criteria . Two reviewers performed independent , in-depth reviews of each eligible study , and a third reviewer was consulted for disagreements . Data from accepted papers were extracted into evidence tables , and the evidence was synthesized according to the modified SIGN criteria .

ERROR 21802369: 22623996	Œ±-Thalassemia impairs the cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes . 	BACKGROUND : Œ±-Thalassemia results from decreased production of Œ±-globin chains that make up part of hemoglobin tetramers and affects up to 50 % of individuals in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa . Heterozygous and homozygous genotypes are associated with reduced risk of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria , but the mechanism of this protection remains obscure . We hypothesized that Œ±-thalassemia impairs the adherence of parasitized red blood cells to microvascular endothelial cells and monocytes -- two interactions that are centrally involved in the pathogenesis of severe disease . METHODS AND FINDINGS : We obtained P. falciparum isolates directly from Malian children with malaria and used them to infect Œ±Œ± / Œ±Œ± , -Œ± / Œ±Œ± and -Œ ±/- Œ± RBCs . We also used laboratory-adapted P. falciparum clones to infect -/- Œ± RBCs obtained from patients with HbH disease . Following a single cycle of parasite invasion and maturation to the trophozoite stage , we tested the ability of parasitized RBCs to bind MVECs and monocytes . Compared to parasitized Œ±Œ± / Œ±Œ± RBCs , we found that parasitized -Œ± / Œ±Œ± , -Œ ±/- Œ± and -/- Œ± RBCs showed , respectively , 22 % , 43 % and 63 % reductions in binding to MVECs and 13 % , 33 % and 63 % reductions in binding to monocytes . Œ±-Thalassemia was associated with abnormal display of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 , the parasite &apos; s main cytoadherence ligand and virulence factor , on the surface of parasitized RBCs . CONCLUSIONS : Parasitized Œ±-thalassemic RBCs show PfEMP1 display abnormalities that are reminiscent of those on the surface of parasitized sickle HbS and HbC RBCs . Our data suggest a model of malaria protection in which Œ±-thalassemia ameliorates the pro-inflammatory effects of cytoadherence . Our findings also raise the possibility that other unstable hemoglobins such as HbE and unpaired Œ±-globin chains protect against life-threatening malaria by a similar mechanism . 	2012	2012-05-25	PloS one;2012;7;5;e37214;	Krause,Michael A,MA;Diakite,Seidina A S,SA;Lopera-Mesa,Tatiana M,TM;Amaratunga,Chanaki,C;Arie,Takayuki,T;Traore,Karim,K;Doumbia,Saibou,S;Konate,Drissa,D;Keefer,Jeffrey R,JR;Diakite,Mahamadou,M;Fairhurst,Rick M,RM;	-0.549352

Osteoarthritis constitutes a major health problem . Different signaling pathways are involved that impair homeostasis , but the cross-talk between them , remains unclear . HIF-1Œ± promotes chondrocyte differentiation and survival , while HIF-2Œ± coactivates with Œ≤-catenin and NF-Œ∫B pathways to promote chondrocyte apoptosis and endochondral ossification . Depending on the ALK1 / ALK5 ratio in chondrocytes , the TGFŒ≤ pathway can play an anabolic or catabolic role . TGFŒ≤1 can activate the Œ≤-catenin signaling pathway via ALK5 , Smad3 , PI3K , and PKA pathways . The mediator Axins balance TGF-Œ≤ and Wnt / Œ≤-catenin signaling during chondrocyte proliferation and maturation . However , the biological functions of Wnt / Œ≤-catenin signaling are still controversial . Both excessive and insufficient Œ≤-catenin levels may impair the homeostasis of articular chondrocytes by enhancing pathological maturation and apoptosis , respectively ; loss- and gain-of-functions of Œ≤-catenin cause apoptosis at the center of the joint and chondrocyte maturation at the periphery , depending on the vascularity . The NF-Œ∫B transcription factor can be triggered by a host of stress-related stimuli including pro-inflammatory cytokines .

BACKGROUND : To date , research has identified distinct antipsychotic response trajectories yet focussing on data from randomized-controlled trials . Therefore , the heterogeneity of response in &quot; real-world &quot; schizophrenia patients is still unknown . METHODS : Antipsychotic response was evaluated in 399 patients suffering from a schizophrenia spectrum disorder within a naturalistic multicenter study of the Competence Network on Schizophrenia using latent class regression . Baseline and illness-related variables were compared between the different trajectory classes as well as currently proposed outcome definitions using univariate tests . In order to predict the trajectory group membership classification and regression tree analysis were furthermore performed . RESULTS : Five distinct trajectories of antipsychotic response were identified : Class 1 showing an early and considerable improvement , Class 2 incorporating patients with the greatest response to treatment , Class 3 again showing an early improvement to treatment yet with a slightly lower degree of improvement , Class 4 featuring patients gradually responding to treatment , and Class 5 with the poorest antipsychotic response . Fewer depressive symptoms at admission , better functioning , a shorter duration of illness and less previous hospitalizations were found to be significant predictors of good response . No considerable differences were found comparing the present results to the previous trajectory analyses deriving from RCTs . CONCLUSION : Our results underline the heterogeneous course of response independent of the study or treatment design suggesting that the diversity in schizophrenia response and outcome is determined primarily by different pathophysiological underpinnings . 	2012	2012-06-05	Schizophrenia research;2012 Aug;139;1-3;218-24;	Schennach,Rebecca,R;Meyer,Sebastian,S;Seem√ºller,Florian,F;J√§ger,Markus,M;Schmauss,Max,M;Laux,Gerd,G;Pfeiffer,Herbert,H;Naber,Dieter,D;Schmidt,Lutz G,LG;Gaebel,Wolfgang,W;Klosterk√∂tter,Joachim,J;Heuser,Isabella,I;Maier,Wolfgang,W;Lemke,Matthias R,MR;R√	-1.39404
ERROR 21829166: 22662132	Topical insulin accelerates wound healing in diabetes by enhancing the AKT and ERK pathways : a double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial . 	BACKGROUND : Wound healing is impaired in diabetes mellitus , but the mechanisms involved in this process are virtually unknown . Proteins belonging to the insulin signaling pathway respond to insulin in the skin of rats . OBJECTIVE : The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulation of the insulin signaling pathway in wound healing and skin repair of normal and diabetic rats , and , in parallel , the effect of a topical insulin cream on wound healing and on the activation of this pathway . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : We investigated insulin signaling by immunoblotting during wound healing of control and diabetic animals with or without topical insulin . Diabetic patients with ulcers were randomized to receive topical insulin or placebo in a prospective , double-blind and placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial of wound healing . RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS : Expression of IR , IRS-1 , IRS-2 , SHC , ERK , and AKT are increased in the tissue of healing wounds compared to intact skin , suggesting that the insulin signaling pathway may have an important role in this process . These pathways were attenuated in the wounded skin of diabetic rats , in parallel with an increase in the time of complete wound healing . Upon topical application of insulin cream , the wound healing time of diabetic animals was normalized , followed by a reversal of defective insulin signal transduction . In addition , the treatment also increased expression of other proteins , such as eNOS , VEGF , and SDF-1Œ± in wounded skin . In diabetic patients , topical insulin cream markedly improved wound healing , representing an attractive and cost-free method for treating this devastating complication of diabetes .

A benchmarking approach was developed in Spain to identify and spread critical success factors in the process of donation after brain death . This paper describes the methodology to identify the best performer hospitals in the period 2003-2007 with 106 hospitals throughout the country participating in the project . The process of donation after brain death was structured into three phases : referral of possible donors after brain death to critical care units from outside units , management of possible DBDs within the CCUs and obtaining consent for organ donation . Indicators to assess performance in each phase were constructed and the factors influencing these indicators were studied to ensure that comparable groups of hospitals could be established . Availability of neurosurgery and CCU resources had a positive impact on the referral of possible DBDs to CCUs and those hospitals with fewer annual potential DBDs more frequently achieved 100 % consent rates . Hospitals were grouped into each subprocess according to influencing factors . Hospitals with the best results were identified for each phase and hospital group . The subsequent study of their practices will lead to the identification of critical factors for success , which implemented in an adapted way should fortunately lead to increasing organ availability . 	2012	2012-06-12	American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons;2012 Sep;12;9;2498-506;	Matesanz,R,R;Coll,E,E;Dom√≠nguez-Gil,B,B;de la Rosa,G,G;Marazuela,R,R;Arr√°ez,V,V;Elorrieta,P,P;Fern√°ndez-Garc√≠a,A,A;Fern√°ndez-Renedo,C,C;Gal√°n,J,J;G√≥mez-Marinero,P,P;Mart√≠n-Delagebasala,C,C;Mart√≠n-Jim√©nez,S,S;Masnou,N,N;Salamero,P,P;S√°nchez-Ib√	-1.25441

ERROR 21846410: 22682746	Tumor reoxygenation following administration of Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase inhibitors : a rationale for combination with radiation therapy . 	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE : The relevance of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase inhibitors as co-treatments for radiation therapy is investigated , with special focus on a potential link between the MAPK pathway and tumor hypoxia , which is a critical determinant for response to therapy . MATERIALS AND METHODS : The effects of two MAPK inhibitors , Sorafenib and PD0325901 , were monitored daily using in vivo EPR oximetry in FSaII and TLT tumor models in order to identify a window of reoxygenation , during which tumor blood flow , oxygen consumption and radiation sensitivity were assessed . RESULTS : Reoxygenation was shown after two days of treatments with Sorafenib or PD0325901 in two tumor models , which was further successfully exploited with Sorafenib for improving the radiation response of FSaII tumors by a factor of 1.5 . The increase in tumor oxygenation was shown to be the result of two major factors : an increase in blood flow for Sorafenib , that might be linked to its anti-angiogenic effect , and a decrease in oxygen consumption for Sorafenib and PD0325901 , due to an alteration of the mitochondrial activity . CONCLUSION : We evidenced tumor reoxygenation in vivo following MAPK inhibition and suggest a rationale for the combination of radiation therapy with Sorafenib . 	2012	2012-06-12	Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology;2012 Oct;105;1;64-71;	Karroum,Oussama,O;Kengen,Julie,J;Danhier,Pierre,P;Magat,Julie,J;Mignion,Lionel,L;Bouzin,Caroline,C;Verrax,Julien,J;Charette,Nicolas,N;Starkel,Peter,P;Calderon,Pedro Buc,PB;Sonveaux,Pierre,P;Feron,Oliver,O;Gr√©goire,Vincent,V;Gallez,Bernard,B;Jordan,B√©n√	-0.878472

Endothelial dysfunction plays a key role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease . Herein , we have analyzed if the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Œ ≤/- Œ¥ agonist GW0742 exerts protective effects on endothelial function in type 1 diabetic rats . The rats were divided into 4 groups : control , control-treated , diabetic , and diabetic-treated . GW0742 administration in diabetic rats did not alter plasma glucose , systolic blood pressure , or heart rate , but reduced plasma triglyceride levels . The vasodilatation induced by acetylcholine was decreased in aortas from diabetic rats . GW0742 restored endothelial function , increasing eNOS phosphorylation . Superoxide production , NADPH oxidase activity , and mRNA expression of prepro endothelin-1 , p22 , p47 , and NOX-1 were significantly higher in diabetic aortas , and GW0742 treatment prevented these changes . In addition , GW0742 prevented the endothelial dysfunction and the upregulation of prepro endothelin-1 and p47 after the in vitro incubation of aortic rings with high glucose and these effects were prevented by the PPARŒ≤ / Œ¥ antagonist GSK0660 . PPARŒ≤ / Œ¥ activation restores endothelial function in type 1 diabetic rats . This effect seems to be related to an increase in nitric oxide bioavailability as a result of reduced NADPH oxidase-driven superoxide production and downregulation of prepro endothelin-1 . 	2012	2012-06-12	Free radical biology &amp; medicine;2012 Aug 15;53;4;730-41;	Quintela,Ana Mar√≠a,AM;Jim√©nez,Rosario,R;G√≥mez-Guzm√°n,Manuel,M;Zarzuelo,Mar√≠a Jos√©,MJ;Galindo,Pilar,P;S√°nchez,Manuel,M;Vargas,F√©lix,F;Cogolludo,Angel,A;Tamargo,Juan,J;P√©rez-Vizca√≠no,Francisco,F;Duarte,Juan,J;	-1.24763

BACKGROUND : Galectins are potent immune regulators , with galectin-8 acting as a pro-apoptotic effector on synovial fluid cells and thymocytes and stimulator on T-cells . To set a proof-of-principle example for risk assessment in autoimmunity , and for a mutation affecting physiological galectin sensor functions , a polymorphism in the coding region of the galectin-8 gene was studied for its association with two autoimmune disorders , i.e. rheumatoid arthritis and myasthenia gravis . METHODS : A case-control analysis and a related quantitative trait-association study were performed to investigate the association of this polymorphism in patients and 365 ethnically matched healthy controls . Distribution was also investigated in patients grouped according to their antibody status and age at disease onset . Comparative testing for lectin activity was carried out in ELISA / ELLA-based binding tests with both wild-type and F19Y mutant galectin-8 from peripheral blood mononuclear cell lysates of healthy individuals with different genotypes as well as with recombinant wild-type and F19Y mutant galectin-8 proteins . RESULTS : A strong association was found for rheumatoid arthritis , and a mild one with myasthenia gravis . Furthermore , the presence of the sequence deviation also correlated with age at disease onset in the case of rheumatoid arthritis . The F19Y substitution did not appear to affect carbohydrate binding in solid-phase assays markedly .

Increased adipocyte chemokine ligand 2 secretion may initiate adipose inflammation by attracting the migration of inflammatory cells into the tissue . Using an unbiased approach , we identified adipose microRNAs that are dysregulated in human obesity and assessed their possible role in controlling CCL2 production . In subcutaneous WAT obtained from 56 subjects , 11 miRNAs were present in all subjects and downregulated in obesity . Of these , 10 affected adipocyte CCL2 secretion in vitro and for 2 miRNAs , regulatory circuits were defined . While miR-126 bound directly to the 3 &apos; -untranslated region of CCL2 mRNA , miR-193b regulated CCL2 production indirectly through a network of transcription factors , many of which have been identified in other inflammatory conditions . In addition , overexpression of miR-193b and miR-126 in a human monocyte / macrophage cell line attenuated CCL2 production . The levels of the two miRNAs in subcutaneous WAT were significantly associated with CCL2 secretion and expression of integrin , Œ±-X , an inflammatory macrophage marker . Taken together , our data suggest that miRNAs may be important regulators of adipose inflammation through their effects on CCL2 release from human adipocytes and macrophages . 	2012	2012-06-13	Diabetes;2012 Aug;61;8;1986-93;	Arner,Erik,E;Mejhert,Niklas,N;Kulyt√©,Agn√©,A;Balwierz,Piotr J,PJ;Pachkov,Mikhail,M;Cormont,Mireille,M;Lorente-Cebri√°n,Silvia,S;Ehrlund,Anna,A;Laurencikiene,Jurga,J;Hed√©n,Per,P;Dahlman-Wright,Karin,K;Tanti,Jean-Fran√ßois,JF;Hayashizaki,Yoshihide,Y;Ryd√	-0.806966

BACKGROUND : Human papillomavirus is a sexually transmitted infection that may lead to development of precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix . The aim of the current study was to investigate socio-demographic , lifestyle , and medical factors for potential associations with cervical HPV infection in women undergoing cervical cancer screening in Spain . METHODS : The CLEOPATRE Spain study enrolled 3 261 women aged 18-65‚Äâyears attending cervical cancer screening across the 17 Autonomous Communities . Liquid-based cervical samples underwent cytological examination and HPV testing . HPV positivity was determined using the Hybrid Capture II assay , and HPV genotyping was conducted using the INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra assay . Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify putative risk factors for HPV infection . RESULTS : A lifetime number of two or more sexual partners , young age , a history of genital warts , and unmarried status were the strongest independent risk factors for HPV infection of any type . Living in an urban community , country of birth other than Spain , low level of education , and current smoking status were also independent risk factors for HPV infection . A weak inverse association between condom use and HPV infection was observed . Unlike monogamous women , women with two or more lifetime sexual partners showed a lower risk of infection if their current partner was circumcised and a higher risk of infection if they were current smokers . CONCLUSION : This is the first large-scale , country-wide study exploring risk factors for cervical HPV infection in Spain . The data strongly indicate that variables related to sexual behavior are the main risk factors for HPV infection . In addition , in non-monogamous women , circumcision of the partner is associated with a reduced risk and smoking with an increased risk of HPV infection . 	2012	2012-06-28	BMC infectious diseases;2012;12;;145;	Roura,Esther,E;Iftner,Thomas,T;Vidart,Jos√© Antonio,JA;Kjaer,Susanne Kr√ºger,SK;Bosch,F Xavier,FX;Mu√±oz,Nubia,N;Palacios,Santiago,S;Rodriguez,Maria San Martin,MS;Morillo,Carmen,C;Serradell,Laurence,L;Torcel-Pagnon,Laurence,L;Cortes,Javier,J;Castellsagu√	-1.23557

The test characteristics of bedside ultrasonography were determined with the final radiologist / cardiologist interpretation . MAIN FINDINGS : A total of 275 ultrasonographic examinations were performed . Radiologists / cardiologists detected 28 cases of cholecystitis , 26 cases of deep vein thrombosis , 49 cases of hydronephrosis , and 15 cases of significant cardiovascular alterations . The overall diagnostic accuracy of ED ultrasonograms yielded a sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , and negative predictive value of 92.6 % , 89 % , 86.2 % , and 94.2 % , respectively . Nineteen false-positive results and 6 false-negative results were obtained . PRINCIPAL CONCLUSIONS : Emergency physicians in our institution attained reasonably high initial accuracy in the performance of ultrasonography for a variety of clinical problems after a 10-hour training period . 	2012	2012-07-17	The American journal of emergency medicine;2012 Nov;30;9;1943-9;	Torres-Macho,Juan,J;Ant√≥n-Santos,Juan M,JM;Garc√≠a-Gutierrez,Isabel,I;de Castro-Garc√≠a,Mar√≠a,M;G√°mez-D√≠ez,Sergio,S;de la Torre,Pilar Garc√≠a,PG;Latorre-Barcenilla,Gonzalo,G;Majo-Carbajo,Yolanda,Y;Reparaz-Gonz√°lez,Juan C,JC;de Casasola,Gonzalo Garc√	-1.19698
ERROR 21941683: 22797131	Monitoring breathing rate at home allows early identification of COPD exacerbations . 	BACKGROUND : Respiratory frequency increases during exacerbations of COPD . We hypothesized that this increase can be detected at home before ECOPD hospitalization . METHODS : To test this hypothesis , respiratory frequency was monitored at home daily for 3 months in 89 patients with COPD who were receiving domiciliary oxygen therapy . RESULTS : During follow-up , 30 patients required hospitalization because of ECOPD . In 21 of them , mean respiratory frequency increased during the 5 days that preceded it . This was not the case in patients without ECOPD . Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that 24 h before hospitalization , a mean increase of 4.4 / min provided the best combination of sensitivity and specificity . Two days before hospitalization , a mean increase of 2.3 / min was associated with a sensitivity of 72 % and a specificity of 77 % . CONCLUSIONS : Respiratory frequency can be monitored daily at home in patients with COPD receiving domiciliary oxygen therapy . In these patients , breathing rate increases significantly days before they require hospitalization because of ECOPD . This may offer a window of opportunity for early intervention . 	2012	2012-07-17	Chest;2012 Dec;142;6;1524-9;	Ya√±ez,Aina M,AM;Guerrero,Dolores,D;P√©rez de Alejo,Rigoberto,R;Garcia-Rio,Francisco,F;Alvarez-Sala,Jose Luis,JL;Calle-Rubio,Miriam,M;Malo de Molina,Rosa,R;Valle Falcones,Manuel,M;Ussetti,Piedad,P;Sauleda,Jaume,J;Zamora Garc√≠a,Enrique,E;Rodr√≠guez-Gonz√	-0.998874
ERROR 21943049: 22798679	Dynamics of human prothymocytes and xenogeneic thymopoiesis in hematopoietic stem cell-engrafted nonobese diabetic-SCID / IL-2rŒ≥null mice . 	To model the developmental pattern of human prothymocytes and thymopoiesis , we used NOD-scid / Œ≥c mice grafted with human umbilical cord blood CD34 hematopoietic progenitor cells . Human prothymocytes developed in the murine bone marrow from multipotent CD34CD38lineage HPCs to CD34CD7CD2 pro-T1 cells that progressed in a Notch-dependent manner to CD34CD7CD2 pro-T2 cells , which migrated to the thymus . BM prothymocyte numbers peaked 1 mo after graft , dropped at mo 2 , and persisted at low levels thereafter , with only a few CD34CD7 prothymocytes with limited T potential being detected by mo 5 . As a consequence , thymopoiesis in this xenogeneic setting began by weeks 4-6 , peaked at mo 3 , and decreased thenceforth . Analyzing mice grafted at 2 , 4 or 8 , mo of age showed that in an &quot; older &quot; BM , prothymocyte differentiation was perturbed and resulted in CD34CD7 prothymocytes with limited T potential . Whereas the early drop in BM thymopoietic activity was related to a Notch-independent loss of T potential by CD34CD38lineage HPCs , the later age-dependent production decline of prothymocytes was linked to a more complex mix of cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental defects . Accordingly , and contrasting with what was observed with umbilical cord blood HPCs , CD34 HPCs from human adult BM displayed only marginal thymopoietic activity when grafted into young 2-mo-old NOD-scid / Œ≥c mice . These data demonstrate that the developmental pattern of BM prothymocytes during human late fetal and early postnatal life can be reproduced in humanized mice , and they suggest that onset of human thymus involution relates to decreased colonization by prothymocytes . 	2012	2012-07-17	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);2012 Aug 15;189;4;1648-60;	Parietti,V√©ronique,V;Nelson,Elisabeth,E;Telliam,Gladys,G;Le Noir,Sandrine,S;Pla,Marika,M;Delord,Marc,M;Vanneaux,Val√©rie,V;Mohtashami,Mahmood,M;Macintyre,Elizabeth A,EA;Gluckman,Jean Claude,JC;Asnafi,Vahid,V;Z√∫√±iga-Pfl√ºcker,Juan-Carlos,JC;Larghero,J√	-0.895476
ERROR 21949186: 22806286	Current use of equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate in Spanish laboratories . 	INTRODUCTION : In 2006 the Spanish Society of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology and the Spanish Society of Nephrology developed a consensus document in order to facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of chronic kidney disease with the incorporation of equations for estimating glomerular filtration rate into laboratory reports . The current national prevalence of eGFR reporting and the degree of adherence to these recommendations among clinical laboratories is unknown . METHODS : We administered a national survey in 2010-11 to Spanish clinical laboratories . The survey was through e-mail or telephone to laboratories that participated in the SEQC &amp; rsquo ; s Programme for External Quality Assurance , included in the National Hospitals Catalogue 2010 , including both primary care and private laboratories . RESULTS : A total of 281 laboratories answered to the survey . Of these , 88.2 % reported on the eGFR , with 61.9 % reporting on the MDRD equation and 31.6 % using the MDRD-IDMS equation . A total of 42.5 % of laboratories always reported serum creatinine values , and other variables only when specifically requested . Regarding the way results were presented , 46.2 % of laboratories reported the exact numerical value only when the filtration rate was below 60mL / min / 1.73m2 , while 50.6 % reported all values regardless . In 56.3 % of the cases reporting eGFR , an interpretive commentary of it was enclosed . CONCLUSIONS : Although a high percentage of Spanish laboratories have added eGFR in their reports , this metric is not universally used . Moreover , some aspects , such as the equation used and the correct expression of eGFR results , should be improved . 	2012	2012-07-19	Nefrolog√≠a : publicaci√≥n oficial de la Sociedad Espa√±ola Nefrologia;2012 Jul 17;32;4;508-16;	Gr√†cia-Garcia,S√≠lvia,S;Monta√±√©s-Berm√∫dez,Rosario,R;Morales-Garc√≠a,Luis J,LJ;D√≠ez-de Los R√≠os,M Jos√©,MJ;Jim√©nez-Garc√≠a,Juan √Å,J√Å;Mac√≠as-Blanco,Carlos,C;Mart√≠nez-L√≥pez,Rosalina,R;Ruiz-Altarejos,Joaqu√≠n,J;Ruiz-Mart√≠n,Guadalupe,G;Sanz-Hern√	-1.45431
ERROR 21952180: 22809390	Stress amplifies lung tissue mechanics , inflammation and oxidative stress induced by chronic inflammation . 	BACKGROUND : Mechanisms linking behavioral stress and inflammation are poorly understood , mainly in distal lung tissue . OBJECTIVE : We have investigated whether the forced swim stress could modulate lung tissue mechanics , iNOS , cytokines , oxidative stress activation , eosinophilic recruitment , and remodeling in guinea pigs with chronic pulmonary inflammation . METHODS : The GP were exposed to ovalbumin or saline aerosols . Twenty-four hours after the 4th inhalation , the GP were submitted to the FS protocol . Seventy-two hours after the 7th inhalation , lung strips were cut and tissue resistance and elastance were obtained . Strips were submitted to histopathological evaluation . RESULTS : The adrenals &apos; weight , the serum cortisol , and the catecholamines were measured . There was an increase in IL-2 , IL-5 , IL-13 , IFN-Œ≥ , iNOS , 8-iso-PGF2Œ± , and in % Rt and % Et after Ach challenge in the SAL-S group compared to the SAL one . The OVA-S group has had an increase in % Rt and % Et after the OVA challenge , in % Et after the Ach and in IL-4 , 8-iso-PGF2Œ± , and actin compared to the OVA . Adrenal weight and cortisol serum were increased in stressed animals compared to nonstressed ones , and the catecholamines were unaltered . CONCLUSION &amp; CLINICAL RELEVANCE : Repeated stress has increased distal lung constriction , which was associated with an increase of actin , IL-4 , and 8-iso-PGF2Œ± levels .

BACKGROUND : Chronic kidney disease progression has been linked to pro-inflammatory cytokines and markers of inflammation . These markers are also elevated in end-stage renal disease , which constitutes a serious public health problem . OBJECTIVE : To investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms located in genes related to immune and inflammatory processes , could be associated with ESRD development . DESIGN AND METHODS : A retrospective case-control study was carried out on 276 patients with ESRD and 288 control subjects . Forty-eight SNPs were genotyped via SNPlex platform . Logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between each sigle polymorphism and the development of ESRD . RESULTS : Four polymorphisms showed association with ESRD : rs1801275 in the interleukin 4 receptor gene , rs4586 in chemokine ligand 2 gene , rs301640 located in an intergenic binding site for signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 and rs7830 in the nitric oxide synthase 3 gene .

ERROR 21979626: 22842791	Behavioral , neurochemical and pharmaco-EEG profiles of the psychedelic drug 4-bromo-2 , 5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in rats . 	RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES : Behavioral , neurochemical and pharmaco-EEG profiles of a new synthetic drug 4-bromo-2 , 5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in rats were examined . MATERIALS AND METHODS : Locomotor effects , prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle reaction , dopamine and its metabolite levels in nucleus accumbens , EEG power spectra and coherence in freely moving rats were analysed . Amphetamine was used as a reference compound . RESULTS : 2C-B had a biphasic effect on locomotion with initial inhibitory followed by excitatory effect ; amphetamine induced only hyperlocomotion . Both drugs induced deficits in the PPI ; however they had opposite effects on ASR . 2C-B increased dopamine but decreased 3 , 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the NAc . Low doses of 2C-B induced a decrease in EEG power spectra and coherence . On the contrary , high dose of 2C-B 50¬†mg / kg had a temporally biphasic effect with an initial decrease followed by an increase in EEG power ; decrease as well as increase in EEG coherence was observed . Amphetamine mainly induced an increase in EEG power and coherence in theta and alpha bands . Increases in the theta and alpha power and coherence in 2C-B and amphetamine were temporally linked to an increase in locomotor activity and DA levels in NAc . CONCLUSIONS : 2C-B is a centrally active compound similar to other hallucinogens , entactogens and stimulants . Increased dopamine and decreased DOPAC in the NAc may reflect its psychotomimetic and addictive potential and monoaminoxidase inhibition . Alterations in brain functional connectivity reflected the behavioral and neurochemical changes produced by the drug ; a correlation between EEG changes and locomotor behavior was observed . 	2012	2012-07-31	Psychopharmacology;2012 Jul 29;;;;	P√°len√≠ƒçek,Tom√°≈°,T;Fuj√°kov√°,Michaela,M;Brunovsk√Ω,Martin,M;Hor√°ƒçek,Ji≈ô√≠,J;Gorman,Ingmar,I;Bal√≠kov√°,Marie,M;Rambousek,Luk√°≈°,L;Syslov√°,Kamila,K;Kaƒçer,Petr,P;Zach,Petr,P;Buben√≠kov√°-Vale≈°ov√°,Vƒõra,V;Tyl≈°,Filip,F;Kube≈°ov√°,Anna,A;Puskarƒ	-1.27159

Chromosomal rearrangements affecting the MLL gene are associated with high-risk pediatric , adult and therapy-associated acute leukemia . In this study , conventional cytogenetic , fluorescence in situ hybridization , and molecular genetic studies were used to characterize the type and frequency of MLL rearrangements in a consecutive series of 45 Portuguese patients with MLL-related leukemia treated in a single institution between 1998 and 2011 . In the group of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and an identified MLL fusion partner , 47 % showed the presence of an MLL-AFF1 fusion , as a result of a t . In the remaining cases , a MLL-MLLT3 , a MLL-MLLT1 , or MLL-MLLT4 rearrangement was found . The most frequent rearrangement found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia was the MLL-MLLT3 fusion , followed by MLL-MLLT10 , MLL-MLLT1 , MLL-ELL , MLL-MLLT4 , and MLL-MLLT11 . In three patients , fusions involving MLL and a septin family gene , were identified . The most frequently identified chromosomal rearrangements were reciprocal translocations , but insertions and deletions , some cryptic , were also observed . In our series , patients with MLL rearrangements were shown to have a poor prognosis , regardless of leukemia subtype . Interestingly , children with 1 year or less showed a statistically significant better overall survival when compared with both older children and adults . The use of a combined strategy in the initial genetic evaluation of acute leukemia patients allowed us to characterize the pattern of MLL rearrangements in our institution , including our previous discovery of two novel MLL fusion partners , the SEPT2 and CT45A2 genes , and a very rare MLL-MLLT4 fusion variant . 	2012	2012-08-01	Molecular oncology;2012 Oct;6;5;553-64;	Cerveira,Nuno,N;Lisboa,Susana,S;Correia,Cec√≠lia,C;Bizarro,Susana,S;Santos,Joana,J;Torres,Lurdes,L;Vieira,Joana,J;Barros-Silva,Jo√£o D,JD;Pereira,Dulcineia,D;Moreira,Cl√°udia,C;Meyer,Claus,C;Oliva,Tereza,T;Moreira,Il√≠dia,I;Martins,√Çngelo,√Ç;Viterbo,Lu√	-0.903957

However , the influence of individual CRFs on trabecular mechanical fragility is still a subject of debate . In this study , we aimed to assess differences , adjusted for CRFs , between bone macrostructural parameters measured in ex-vivo specimens from hip fragility fracture patients and osteoarthritis patients , and to determine whether individual CRFs could predict trabecular bone mechanical behavior in hip fragility fractures . Additionally , we also looked for associations between the 10-year risk of major and hip fracture calculated by FRAX and trabecular bone mechanical performance . In this case-control study , a group of fragility fracture patients were compared with a group of osteoarthritis patients , both having undergone hip replacement surgery . A clinical protocol was applied in order to collect CRFs . The 10-year probability of fracture was calculated . Serum bone turnover markers were determined and dual X-ray absorptiometry performed . Femoral head diameter was evaluated and trabecular bone cylinders were drilled for mechanical testing to determine bone strength , stiffness and toughness . We evaluated 40 hip fragility fracture and 52 osteoarthritis patients . Trabecular bone stiffness was significantly lower in hip fragility fracture patients when compared to osteoarthritic individuals , adjusted for age , gender and BMI . No other macrostructural parameter was statistically different between the groups . In hip fragility fracture patients , smoking habits and female gender were independently associated with lower stiffness . In addition , smoking was also independently associated with worse trabecular strength , and toughness . In these patients , the 10-year risk of major and hip fracture calculated using only CRFs was strongly correlated with femoral neck bone mineral density but not with mechanical performance . Our data showed that among fragility fracture patients active smoking is a predictor of worse intrinsic trabecular mechanical performance , and female gender is also independently associated with lower stiffness . In this population , the 10-year risk of fracture using CRFs with different weights only reflects bone mass loss but not trabecular mechanical properties . 	2012	2012-08-14	Journal of bone and mineral metabolism;2012 Nov;30;6;692-9;	Rodrigues,Ana Maria,AM;Caetano-Lopes,Joana,J;Vale,Ana Catarina,AC;Aleixo,In√™s,I;Pena,Ana Sofia,AS;Faustino,Alexandra,A;Sepriano,Alexandre,A;Polido-Pereira,Joaquim,J;Vieira-Sousa,Elsa,E;Lucas,Raquel,R;Romeu,Jos√© Carlos,JC;Monteiro,Jacinto,J;Vaz,Maria F√	-1.39455

UNLABELLED : What 's known on the subject ? and What does the study add ? In spite of its low specificity , PSA is the most widely used screening test for prostate cancer , and is considered the main cause of the stage migration recently observed . The ratio of free to total PSA has been shown to increase PSA accuracy in cancer detection ; however , few screening studies have systematically evaluated its role in cancer detection rates in men with PSA levels &lt; 4.0 ng / mL and normal DRE . The present study supports a possible role of % fPSA as an adjunct to screening in men with total PSA 2.5-4.0 ng / mL and normal DRE , with a marked increase in cancer detection rates in a large Brazilian PCa screening study . We believe that % fPSA maybe a useful refinement to biopsy indications in men with low PSA levels . OBJECTIVE : ‚Ä¢ To evaluate the role of the free to total prostate-specific antigen ratio in identifying prostate cancer in men with a prostate-specific antigen level of 2.5-3.9 ng / mL and a normal digital rectal examination . PATIENTS AND METHODS : ‚Ä¢ A prospective PCa screening study was conducted , which included 17571 men aged ‚â• 45 years , across six Brazilian states , where men were recalled for further evaluation in the case of either a suspicious DRE and/or PSA ‚â• 4.0 ng / mL , or PSA 2.5-3.9 ng / mL and % fPSA ‚â§ 15 . ‚Ä¢ We evaluated the impact of a % fPSA ‚â§ 15 on cancer detection rates and the clinical and pathological stage of tumours in men with a normal DRE and PSA 2.5-3.9 ng / mL . RESULTS : ‚Ä¢ When suspicious DRE and/or PSA ‚â• 4.0 ng / mL were considered as criteria to prompt further evaluation , the cancer detection rate was 3.1 % . When % fPSA ‚â§ 15 in men with total PSA levels of 2.5-3.9 ng / mL were considered as criteria , the PCa detection rate increased to 3.7 % . Considering % fPSA ‚â§ 15 in men with PSA 2.5-3.9 ng / mL and normal DRE , the positive predictive value of biopsy was 31.1 % . ‚Ä¢ Clinical stage was more favourable among men with PSA 2.5-3.9 ng / mL , normal DRE , and % fPSA ‚â§ 15 compared with men with normal DRE and PSA ‚â• 4.0 ng / mL . ‚Ä¢ Among those who underwent radical prostatectomy , pathological stage and the proportion of insignificant tumours were similar between men with PSA 2.5-3.9 ng / mL , normal DRE findings and % fPSA ‚â§ 15 , and men with PSA ‚â• 4.0 ng / mL . CONCLUSIONS : ‚Ä¢ The use of % fPSA ‚â§ 15 as a biopsy indication in men with normal DRE and PSA 2.5-4.0 ng / mL in a PCa screening programme , increased cancer detection rates .

ERROR 22052727: 22925929	CD8 T cell priming in the presence of IFN-Œ± renders CTLs with improved responsiveness to homeostatic cytokines and recall antigens : important traits for adoptive T cell therapy . 	Previous mouse and human studies have demonstrated that direct IFN-Œ± / Œ≤ signaling on naive CD8 T cells is critical to support their expansion and acquisition of effector functions . In this study , we show that human naive CD8 T cells primed in the presence of IFN-Œ± possess a heightened ability to respond to homeostatic cytokines and to secondary Ag stimulation , but rather than differentiating to effector or memory CTLs , they preserve nature-like phenotypic features . These are qualities associated with greater efficacy in adoptive immunotherapy . In a mouse model of adoptive transfer , CD8 T cells primed in the presence of IFN-Œ± are able to persist and to mediate a robust recall response even after a long period of naturally driven homeostatic maintenance . The long-lasting persistence of IFN-Œ±-primed CD8 T cells is favored by their enhanced responsiveness to IL-15 and IL-7 , as demonstrated in IL-15 and IL-7 recipient mice . In humans , exposure to IFN-Œ± during in vitro priming of naive HLA-A2 CD8 T cells with autologous dendritic cells loaded with MART1 peptide renders CD8 T cells with an improved capacity to respond to homeostatic cytokines and to specifically lyse MART1-expressing melanoma cells . Furthermore , in a mouse model of melanoma , adoptive transfer of tumor-specific CD8 T cells primed ex vivo in the presence of IFN-Œ± exhibits an improved ability to contain tumor progression . Therefore , exposure to IFN-Œ± during priming of naive CD8 T cells imprints decisive information on the expanded cells that can be exploited to improve the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy . 	2012	2012-08-29	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950);2012 Oct 1;189;7;3299-310;	Hervas-Stubbs,Sandra,S;Manche√±o,Uxua,U;Riezu-Boj,Jose-Ignacio,JI;Larraga,Ana,A;Ochoa,Maria C,MC;Alignani,Diego,D;Alfaro,Carlos,C;Morales-Kastresana,Aizea,A;Gonzalez,Iranzu,I;Larrea,Esther,E;Pircher,Hanspeter,H;Le Bon,Agnes,A;Lopez-Picazo,Jose M,JM;Mart√	-0.970342

Recently , many novel molecular abnormalities were found to be distinctly associated with acute myeloid leukemia . However , their clinical relevance and prognostic implications are not well established . We developed a new combination of high-resolution melting assays on a LightCycler 480 and direct sequencing to detect somatic mutations of ASXL1 , IDH1 , IDH2 , and c-CBL genes to know their incidence and prognostic effect in a cohort of 175 patients with de novo AML : 16 patients carried ASXL1 mutations , 16 patients had IDH variations , and none had c-CBL mutations . Patients with ASXL1 mutations did not harbor IDH1 , FLT3 , or CEBPA mutations , and a combination of ASXL1 and IDH2 mutations was found only in one patient . In addition , we did not find IDH1 and FLT3 or CEBPA mutations concurrently or IDH2 with CEBPA . IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive . Alternatively , NPM1 mutations were concurrently found with ASXL1 , IDH1 , or IDH2 with a variable incidence . Mutations were not significantly correlated with any of the clinical and biological features studied .

CONTEXT : One of the side-effects of interferon-alpha therapy is interferon-induced thyroiditis . The role of lymphocyte subpopulations in IIT melanoma patients remains to be defined . OBJECTIVE : Our objective was to assess different peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations , mainly regulatory T cells , in melanoma patients who developed IIT . DESIGN , PATIENTS AND METHODS : From 30 melanoma patients receiving high dose interferon -alpha 2b treatment , those who developed IIT were selected and compared with patients who did not develop IIT and healthy controls . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained before treatment , mid-treatment , end of treatment , 24 weeks post-treatment and at appearance of IIT . RESULTS : Nine patients developed IIT : 4 Hashimoto &apos; s thyroiditis and 5 destructive thyroiditis . An increase in Tregs was observed in both melanoma groups during HDI treatment . A decrease in CD3 , NKT lymphocyte subpopulations and Bcl2-expression on B-cells was also observed in both groups . However , no changes were observed in the percentage of CD4 , CD8 CD3 Œ≥Œ¥ , CD19 , transitional B cells , NK , iNKT lymphocytes and Th1 / Th2 balance when BT was compared with ET . At TT , IIT patients had a higher Tregs percentage than Co-MM and Co-H , a higher iNKT percentage than Co-MM , a higher transitional B cells percentage than Co-H , a lower CD3 percentage than Co-H and a lower Bcl2 expression on B-cells than Co-H .

Both vitamin D receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Œ≥ are ligand-activated nuclear transcription factors that are instrumental for bone health . While 1Œ± , 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 , the ligand for VDR , is essential for the development and maintenance of healthy bone , PPAR-Œ≥ agonists cause detrimental skeletal effects . Recent studies have revealed evidence for a cross-talk between 1 , 25D3- and PPAR-Œ ±/- Œ¥ ligand-mediated signaling but there is a current lack of knowledge regarding cross-talk between signaling of 1 , 25D3 and the PPAR-Œ≥ ligand mediated signaling . In this study , we investigated the cross-talk between 1 , 25D3- and PPAR-Œ≥ agonist rosiglitazone-mediated signaling in human osteoblasts . 1 , 25D3 slightly but significantly induced expression of the primary PPAR-Œ≥ target gene ANGPTL4 but did not influence FABP4 . 1 , 25D3 did not change rosiglitazone regulation of ANGPTL4 and FABP4 . The other way around , rosiglitazone reduced CYP24A1 gene expression but this did not change CYP24A1 induction by 1 , 25D3 . The findings regarding CYP24A1 gene expression are in line with the observation that 1 , 25D3 levels in medium were not affected by rosiglitazone . Furthermore , rosiglitazone significantly inhibited 1 , 25D3-induction of BGLAP while rosiglitazone alone did not change BGLAP . Additionally , 1 , 25D3 and rosiglitazone increase osteoblast alkaline phosphatase activity and synergistically stimulated extracellular matrix mineralization . In conclusion , these data provide evidence for a cross-talk between rosiglitazone- and 1 , 25D3-mediated signaling leading to an acceleration of extracellular matrix mineralization . The data suggest that the reduction of the mineralization inhibitor BGLAP and the increased differentiation status underlie the increased mineralization . 	2012	2012-09-13	Gene;2013 Jan 10;512;2;438-43;	Woeckel,V J,VJ;Bruedigam,C,C;Koedam,M,M;Chiba,H,H;van der Eerden,B C J,BC;van Leeuwen,J P T M,JP;	-0.822478

OBJECTIVES : The goal of this study was to assess the risk associated with double antiplatelet therapy discontinuation , and specifically , temporary discontinuation , during the first year after drug-eluting stent implantation . BACKGROUND : Doubts remain about the risk of temporary DAT discontinuation within 1 year after DES implantation . METHODS : A total of 1,622 consecutive patients undergoing DES implantation at 29 hospitals were followed up at 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months to record the 1-year antiplatelet therapy discontinuation rate , the number of days without DAT , and the rate of 1-year major cardiac events . Cox regression was used to analyze the association between ATD considered as a time-dependent covariate and 1-year cardiac events . RESULTS : One hundred seventy-two patients interrupted at least 1 antiplatelet drug during the first year after DES implantation , although only 1 during the first month . Most interrupted DAT temporarily : 79 clopidogrel , 38 aspirin , and 55 both drugs . Discontinuation was followed by acute coronary syndrome in 7 , a similar rate of major cardiac events to that in patients without ATD . ATD was not independently associated with 1-year major cardiac events .

OBJECTIVE : Synovitis assessment through evaluation of swollen joints is integral in steering treatment decisions in rheumatoid arthritis . However , there is high inter-observer variation . The objective was to assess if a short collegiate consensus would improve swollen joint agreement between rheumatologists and whether this was affected by experience . METHODS : Eighteen rheumatologists from French university rheumatology units participated in three 30minutes rounds over a half day meeting evaluating joint counts of RA patients in small groups , followed by short consensus discussions . Agreement was evaluated at the end of each round as follows : global agreement of swollen joints swollen joint agreement according to level of experience of the rheumatologist swollen joint count and agreement of disease activity state according to the Disease Activity Score . Agreement was calculated using percentage agreement and kappa . RESULTS : Global agreement of swollen joints failed to improve at the joint level .

Cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins function to prevent apoptosis and are often overexpressed in various cancers . However , mutations in cIAP1 / 2 can activate the alternative NFŒ∫B pathway through IŒ∫BŒ±-kinase-Œ± and are associated with hematopoetic malignancies . In the current study , we found that knockdown of cIAP2 in human mammary epithelial cells resulted in activation of MDM2 through increased SUMOylation and profound reduction of the pool of MDM2 not phosphorylated at Ser166. cIAP2 siRNA markedly decreased p53 levels , which were rescued by addition of the MDM2 inhibitor , Nutlin3a . An IAP antagonist , which induces cIAP degradation , transiently increased MDM2 mRNA . Simultaneous transfection of siRNA for cIAP2 and IKKŒ± reduced MDM2 protein , while expression of a kinase-dead IKKŒ≤ strongly increased non-Ser166 P-MDM2 . Inhibition of either IKKŒ± or -Œ≤ partially rescued p53 levels , while concomitant IKKŒ± / Œ≤ inhibition fully rescued p53 after cIAP2 knockdown . Surprisingly , IKKŒ± knockdown alone increased SUMO-MDM2 , suggesting that in the absence of activation , IKKŒ± can prevent MDM2 SUMOylation . cIAP2 knockdown disrupted the interaction between the MDM2 SUMO ligase , PIAS1 and IKKŒ± . Partial knockdown of cIAP2 cooperated with H-ras-transfected mammary epithelial cells to enhance colony formation . In summary , our data identify a novel role for cIAP2 in maintaining wild-type p53 levels by preventing both an NFŒ∫B-mediated increase and IKKŒ ±/- Œ≤-dependent transcriptional and post-translational modifications of MDM2 . Thus , mutations or reductions in cIAP2 could contribute to cancer promotion , in part , through downregulation of p53 . 	2012	2012-10-04	Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.);2012 Nov 1;11;21;4009-19;	Lau,Rosanna,R;Niu,Min Ying,MY;Pratt,M A Christine,MA;	0.189495

Our aim was to identify the concomitant mutations in Œ±- and Œ≤-globin genes which lead to complex hemoglobinopathies and to establish an appropriate plan of action for each subject , particularly when prenatal diagnosis is necessary . MATERIAL AND METHODS : We studied the association between the Œ≤-globin gene and Œ±-thalassemia genotypes . The reverse hybridization technique was employed to perform molecular analysis , and the results were confirmed by amplification refractory mutation system or restriction fragment length polymorphism technique . RESULTS : We evaluated 36 adult subjects with concomitant mutations in their Œ±- and Œ≤-globin genes . The -Œ± / Œ±Œ± deletion was the commonest defect in the Œ±-chain as expected , followed by Œ ±/- Œ± deletion . Twenty-five of 36 cases were sickle cell trait with coexisting Œ±-thalassemia , while seven Hb S / S patients had concurrent mutations in their Œ±-genes . The coexistence of Œ±Œ± / Œ±Œ± with Hb A / D and with Hb S / D , which is very uncommon , was also detected . There was a subject with compound heterozygosity for Œ≤-globin chain , and also a case who had -Œ± / Œ±Œ± deletion with IVSI.110 / A . CONCLUSIONS : Although limited , our data suggest that it would be valuable to study coexisting Œ±-globin mutations in subjects with sickle cell disease or Œ≤-thalassemia trait during the screening programs for premarital couples , especially in populations with a high frequency of hemoglobinopathies . 	2012	2012-10-12	Archives of medical science : AMS;2012 Sep 8;8;4;644-9;	Guvenc,Birol,B;Canataroglu,Abdullah,A;Unsal,Cagatay,C;Yildiz,Sule Menziletoglu,SM;Turhan,Ferda Tekin,FT;Bozdogan,Sevcan Tug,ST;Dincer,Suleyman,S;Erkman,Hakan,H;	-0.635051
ERROR 22183122: 23064414	Epigenomic analysis detects widespread gene-body DNA hypomethylation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia . 	We have extensively characterized the DNA methylomes of 139 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with mutated or unmutated IGHV and of several mature B-cell subpopulations through the use of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and high-density microarrays . The two molecular subtypes of CLL have differing DNA methylomes that seem to represent epigenetic imprints from distinct normal B-cell subpopulations . DNA hypomethylation in the gene body , targeting mostly enhancer sites , was the most frequent difference between naive and memory B cells and between the two molecular subtypes of CLL and normal B cells . Although DNA methylation and gene expression were poorly correlated , we identified gene-body CpG dinucleotides whose methylation was positively or negatively associated with expression . We have also recognized a DNA methylation signature that distinguishes new clinico-biological subtypes of CLL . We propose an epigenomic scenario in which differential methylation in the gene body may have functional and clinical implications in leukemogenesis . 	2012	2012-10-16	Nature genetics;2012 Nov;44;11;1236-42;	Kulis,Marta,M;Heath,Simon,S;Bibikova,Marina,M;Queir√≥s,Ana C,AC;Navarro,Alba,A;Clot,Guillem,G;Mart√≠nez-Trillos,Alejandra,A;Castellano,Giancarlo,G;Brun-Heath,Isabelle,I;Pinyol,Magda,M;Barber√°n-Soler,Sergio,S;Papasaikas,Panagiotis,P;Jares,Pedro,P;Be√†,S√	-0.921033

ERROR 22246150: 23130754	Opportunistic detection of atrial fibrillation in subjects aged 65 years or older in primare care : a randomised clinical trial of efficacy . DOFA-AP study protocol . 	BACKGROUND : Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend using peripheral blood pulse measuring as a screening test for Atrial Fibrillation . However , there is no adequate evidence supporting the efficacy of such procedure in primary care clinical practice . This paper describes a study protocol designed to verify whether early opportunistic screening for Atrial Fibrillation by measuring blood pulse is more effective than regular practice in subjects aged 65 years attending primary care centers . METHODS / DESIGN : An cluster-randomized controlled trial conducted in Primary Care Centers of the Spanish National Health Service . A total of 269 physicians and nurses will be allocated to one of the two arms of the trial by stratified randomization with a 3 : 2 ratio . As many as 12 870 patients aged 65 years or older and meeting eligibility criteria will be recruited . Randomization and allocation to trial groups will be carried out by a central computer system . The Experimental Group practitioners will conduct an opportunistic case finding for patients with Atrial Fibrillation , while the Control Group practitioners will follow the regular guidelines . The first step will be finding new Atrial Fibrillation cases . A descriptive inferential analysis will be performed . DISCUSSION : If our hypothesis is confirmed , we expect Primary Care professionals to take a more proactive approach and adopt a new protocol when a patient meeting the established screening criteria is identified . Finally , we expect this measure to be incorporated into Clinical Practice Guidelines .

It is unclear whether pituitary carcinomas arise de novo or evolve from adenomas . Methods‚ÄÇ We studied the clinical characteristics and tissue samples from eight pituitary surgeries and the autopsy from a patient with pituitary carcinoma . A 16-year-old female patient was diagnosed with an aggressive Crooke cell macroadenoma . Following transsphenoidal surgery , clinical signs of Cushing disease quickly reappeared . During the 14-year course of the illness , eight pituitary surgeries , three courses of extracranial irradiation and two Yttrium-DOTATOC treatments were undertaken . A bilateral adrenalectomy was performed . The patient died of metastatic disease and uncontrolled hypercortisolism due to an adrenal remnant . A systematic morphologic study of all available surgical and autopsy specimens was undertaken . Results‚ÄÇ Brisk mitotic activity , high Ki-67 and p53 immunolabelling were present in the pituitary samples from the onset . High proportion of tumour cells showed irregular nuclei and large nucleoli , and gradual increase in MGMT staining was observed . The tumour remained of Crooke cell type throughout the course . Autopsy disclosed a postirradiation sarcoma in the pituitary area .

ERROR 22279735: 23164593	Intravascular ultrasound assessed incomplete stent apposition and stent fracture in stent thrombosis after bare metal versus drug-eluting stent treatment the Nordic Intravascular Ultrasound Study . 	BACKGROUND : This prospective multicenter registry used intravascular ultrasound in patients with definite stent thrombosis to compare rates of incomplete stent apposition , stent fracture and stent expansion in patients treated with drug-eluting versus bare metal stents . ST is a rare , but potential life threatening event after coronary stent implantation . The etiology seems to be multifactorial . METHODS : 124 patients with definite ST were assessed by IVUS during the acute ST event . The study was conducted in 15 high-volume percutaneous coronary intervention -centers in the Nordic-Baltic countries . RESULTS : In early or late ST there were no differences in ISA between DES and BMS . In very late ST , ISA was a more frequent finding in DES than in BMS and the maximum ISA area was larger in DES compared to BMS . Further , ISA was more prevalent in sirolimus-eluting than in paclitaxel-eluting stents . Stent fractures were found both in DES and BMS ; p=0.28 , and not related to time of stent thrombosis occurrence . For stents with nominal diameters ‚â•2.75mm , 38 % of the DES and 22 % of the BMS had a minimum stent area of less than 5mm ; p=0.14 . CONCLUSIONS : Very late stent thrombosis was more prevalent and associated with more extensive ISA in DES than in BMS treated patients .

ERROR 22285684: 23171051	Genomic insights into strategies used by Xanthomonas albilineans with its reduced artillery to spread within sugarcane xylem vessels . 	ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : Xanthomonas albilineans causes leaf scald , a lethal disease of sugarcane . X. albilineans exhibits distinctive pathogenic mechanisms , ecology and taxonomy compared to other species of Xanthomonas . For example , this species produces a potent DNA gyrase inhibitor called albicidin that is largely responsible for inducing disease symptoms ; its habitat is limited to xylem ; and the species exhibits large variability . A first manuscript on the complete genome sequence of the highly pathogenic X. albilineans strain GPE PC73 focused exclusively on distinctive genomic features shared with Xylella fastidiosa -- -another xylem-limited Xanthomonadaceae . The present manuscript on the same genome sequence aims to describe all other pathogenicity-related genomic features of X. albilineans , and to compare , using suppression subtractive hybridization , genomic features of two strains differing in pathogenicity . RESULTS : Comparative genomic analyses showed that most of the known pathogenicity factors from other Xanthomonas species are conserved in X. albilineans , with the notable absence of two major determinants of the &quot; artillery &quot; of other plant pathogenic species of Xanthomonas : the xanthan gum biosynthesis gene cluster , and the type III secretion system Hrp . Genomic features specific to X. albilineans that may contribute to specific adaptation of this pathogen to sugarcane xylem vessels were also revealed . SSH experiments led to the identification of 20 genes common to three highly pathogenic strains but missing in a less pathogenic strain . These 20 genes , which include four ABC transporter genes , a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein gene and an oxidoreductase gene , could play a key role in pathogenicity . With the exception of hypothetical proteins revealed by our comparative genomic analyses and SSH experiments , none genes potentially involved in any offensive or counter-defensive mechanism specific to X. albilineans were identified , supposing that X. albilineans has a reduced artillery compared to other pathogenic Xanthomonas species . Particular attention has therefore been given to genomic features specific to X. albilineans making it more capable of evading sugarcane surveillance systems or resisting sugarcane defense systems . CONCLUSIONS : This study confirms that X. albilineans is a highly distinctive species within the genus Xanthomonas , and opens new perpectives towards a greater understanding of the pathogenicity of this destructive sugarcane pathogen . 	2012	2012-11-23	BMC genomics;2012 Nov 21;13;1;658;	Pieretti,Isabelle,I;Royer,Monique,M;Barbe,Val√©rie,V;Carrere,S√©bastien,S;Koebnik,Ralf,R;Couloux,Arnaud,A;Darrasse,Armelle,A;Gouzy,J√©r√¥me,J;Jacques,Marie-Agn√®s,MA;Lauber,Emmanuelle,E;Manceau,Charles,C;Mangenot,Sophie,S;Poussier,St√©phane,S;Segurens,B√	-1.36317

ERROR 22302417: 23188200	High rhinovirus burden in lower airways of children with cystic fibrosis . 	ABSTRACT BACKGROUND : Rhinovirus -induced pulmonary exacerbations are common in cystic fibrosis and have been associated with impaired virus clearance by the CF airway epithelium in vitro . OBJECTIVE : To assess in vivo the association of RV prevalence and load with anti-viral defense mechanisms , airway inflammation and lung function parameters in children with CF as compared to children with other chronic respiratory diseases and controls . METHODS : RV presence and load was measured by real-time RT-PCR in bronchoalveolar lavage samples and related to anti-viral and inflammatory mediators measured in BAL and to clinical parameters . RESULTS : BAL samples were obtained from children with CF , non-CF bronchiectasis , asthma and controls at a median age of 8.2 years . RV was detected in 73 samples . RV prevalence was similar between groups . RV load was higher in CF , especially during pulmonary exacerbations , compared to asthmatics and controls , but similar to non-CF bronchiectasis . In children with CF , RV load was negatively associated with IFN-Œ ≤/- Œª , IL-r1a levels and FEV1 , and positively with CXCL8 and CXCL10 levels . CONCLUSION : RV load in CF BAL is high , especially during exacerbated lung disease . Impaired production of anti-viral mediators may lead to the high RV burden in the lower airways of children with CF . Whether high RV load is a cause or a consequence of inflammation needs further investigation in longitudinal studies.1Division of Pediatric Respiratory Medicine , Department of Pediatrics , University Hospital , Bern , Switzerland ; elisabeth . kieinger @ insel.ch , florian . singer @ insel.ch , marco . alves @ dkf.unibe.ch , philipp . latzin @ insel.ch , carmen . casaulta @ insel.ch , nicolas . regamey @ insel.ch2Department of Clinical Research , University of Bern , Bern , Switzerland ; elisabeth . kieinger @ insel.ch , marco . alves @ dkf.unibe.ch , philipp . latzin @ insel.ch , nicolas . regamey @ insel.ch3Laboratory of Virology , Division of Infectious Diseases and Division of Laboratory Medicine , University of Geneva Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine , University of Geneva , Switzerland ; Caroline .

ERROR 22303341: 23189125	Interruption of CXCL13-CXCR5 axis increases upper genital tract pathology and activation of NKT cells following chlamydial genital infection . 	BACKGROUND : Regulation of immune responses is critical for controlling inflammation and disruption of this process can lead to tissue damage . We reported that CXCL13 was induced in fallopian tube tissue following C. trachomatis infection . Here , we examined the influence of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis in chlamydial genital infection . METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Disruption of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis by injecting anti-CXCL13 Ab to BALB / c mice or using Cxcr5 -/- mice increased chronic inflammation in the upper genital tract after Chlamydia muridarum genital infection . Further studies in Cxcr5 -/- mice showed an elevation in bacterial burden in the GT and increased numbers of neutrophils , activated DCs and activated NKT cells early after infection . After resolution , we noted increased fibrosis and the accumulation of a variety of T cells subsets in the oviducts . NKT cell depletion in vitro reduced IL-17Œ± and various cytokines and chemokines , suggesting that activated NKT cells modulate neutrophils and DCs through cytokine / chemokine secretion . Further , chlamydial glycolipids directly activated two distinct types of NKT cell hybridomas in a cell-free CD1d presentation assay and genital infection of Cd1d -/- mice showed reduced oviduct inflammation compared to WT mice . CXCR5 involvement in pathology was also noted using single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis in C. trachomatis infected women attending a sub-fertility clinic . Women who developed tubal pathology after a C. trachomatis infection had a decrease in the frequency of CXCR5 SNP +10950 T &gt; C . CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE : These experiments indicate that disruption of the CXCL13-CXCR5 axis permits increased activation of NKT cells by type I and type II glycolipids of Chlamydia muridarum and results in UGT pathology potentially through increased numbers of neutrophils and T cell subsets associated with UGT pathology . In addition , CXCR5 appears to contribute to inter-individual differences in human tubal pathology following C. trachomatis infection . 	2012	2012-11-29	PloS one;2012;7;11;e47487;	Jiang,Janina,J;Karimi,Ouafae,O;Ouburg,Sander,S;Champion,Cheryl I,CI;Khurana,Archana,A;Liu,Guangchao,G;Freed,Amanda,A;Pleijster,Jolein,J;Rozengurt,Nora,N;Land,Jolande A,JA;Surcel,Helja-Marja,HM;Tiitinen,Aila',A;Paavonen,Jorma,J;Kronenberg,Mitchell,M;Morr√	-1.15309
ERROR 22318568: 23207140	Sequential induction of type I and II interferons mediates a long-lasting gene induction in the liver in response to a novel toll-like receptor 9 agonist . 	BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS : The toll-like receptor 9 agonist IMO-2125 is currently evaluated in clinical trials for chronic hepatitis C therapy . The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo mode of action of a closely related compound , referred to as immunomodulatory oligonucleotide . METHODS : We analyzed the Jak-STAT pathway activation and induction of interferon-stimulated genes in the liver of wild-type , interferon- / Œ≤ receptor-deficient and interferon-Œ≥-deficient mice after administration of IMO . RESULTS : IMO induced a prolonged activation of the Jak-STAT pathway and upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes in mouse liver . Contrary to the response observed after interferon- Œ± injection , the signalling induced by IMO was not abrogated following repeated administration . At early time points after IMO injection STAT1 phosphorylation and interferon-stimulated gene induction required a functional interferon-Œ ±/- Œ≤ receptor , whereas at the later time points the activation was type I interferon-independent . Microarray analysis revealed that IMO induced broad transcriptional response in the mouse liver . This included upregulation of cytokine and chemokine genes responsible for recruitment of IFN-Œ≥ producers such as T cells and natural killer cells . Interferon-Œ≥-deficient mice showed a transient response to IMO , demonstrating the central role of interferon-Œ≥ in sustained activation of Jak-STAT pathway by IMO . CONCLUSIONS : The bimodal kinetics of response to IMO in the mouse liver are driven by the sequential endogenous production of type I and II interferons . The lack of refractoriness to IMO combined with the long-lasting induction of interferon-stimulated genes reveal a favourable pharmacodynamics profile of this novel TLR9 agonist for the treatment of chronic viral hepatitis . 	2012	2012-12-05	Journal of hepatology;2012 Dec 1;;;;	Makowska,Zuzanna,Z;Blumer,Tanja,T;Duong,Fran√ßois H T,FH;La Monica,Nicola,N;Kandimalla,Ekambar R,ER;Heim,Markus H,MH;	-0.954264

Furthermore , when the compound was administered 1 h post-stroke , a similar effect was observed . In conclusion , these in vitro and in vivo results suggest that ITH33 / IQM9.21 exhibits neuroprotective effects to protect the vulnerable neurons at the ischemic penumbra by an effective and multifaceted mechanism , mediated by reduction of Ca overload , providing mitochondrial protection and antioxidant actions . 	2012	2012-12-12	Neuropharmacology;2012 Dec 7;;;;	Lorrio,Silvia,S;G√≥mez-Rangel,Vanessa,V;Negredo,Pilar,P;Egea,Javier,J;Leon,Rafael,R;Romero,Alejandro,A;Dal-Cim,Tharine,T;Villarroya,Mercedes,M;Rodriguez-Franco,Maria Isabel,MI;Conde,Santiago,S;Arce,Mariana P,MP;Roda,Jose Mar√≠a,JM;Garc√≠a,Antonio G,AG;L√	-1.13321
ERROR 22347684: 23236987	Thyroid dyshormonogenesis is mainly caused by TPO mutations in consanguineous community . 	OBJECTIVE : In this study we aimed to investigate the genetic background of thyroid dyshormonogenesis CONTEX : TDH comprises 10-15 % of all cases of congenital hypothyroidism , which is the most common neonatal endocrine disorder , and might result from disruptions at any stage of thyroid hormone biosynthesis . Currently seven genes have been implicated in the aetiology of the disease . DESIGN : As TDH is mostly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner , we planned to conduct the study in consanguineous / multi case-families . PATIENTS : 104 patients with congenital TDH all coming from consanguineous and/or multi-case families . MEASUREMENTS : Initially we performed potential linkage analysis of cases to all seven causative-TDH loci as well as direct sequencing of the TPO gene in cases we could not exclude linkage to this locus . Additionally in silico analyses of novel missense mutations were carried out . Results : TPO had the highest potential for linkage and we identified 21 TPO mutations in 28 TDH cases showing potential linkage to this locus . Four of 10 distinct TPO mutations detected in this study were novel . CONCLUSIONS : This study underlines the importance of molecular genetic studies in diagnosis , classification and prognosis of CH and proposes a comprehensive mutation screening by new sequencing technology in all newly diagnosed primary CH cases . ¬© 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd . 	2012	2012-12-15	Clinical endocrinology;2012 Dec 13;;;;	Cangul,Hakan,H;Aycan,Zehra,Z;Olivera-Nappa,Alvaro,A;Saglam,Halil,H;Schoenmakers,Nadia A,NA;Boelaert,Kristien,K;Cetinkaya,Semra,S;Tarim,Omer,O;Bober,Ece,E;Darendeliler,Feyza,F;Bas,Veysel,V;Demir,Korcan,K;Aydin,Banu K,BK;Kendall,Michaela,M;Cole,Trevor,T;H√	-1.1961

Using this biochip , allele and genotype frequencies for the polymorphisms of HTR2A , BDNF and SLC6A4 genes in 198 patients with schizophrenia and 192 healthy individuals have been obtained . The allele T of the HTR2A polymorphism rs6314 was identified as protective against the development of paranoid schizophrenia . An analysis of gene-gene interactions using the Multifactor-Dimensionality Reduction algorithm has shown a statistically significant association of combined genotypes rs6311 G/- , rs6313 C/- , rs6314 C / C , rs7997012 G/- with the disease . Also it has been shown that the G / G genotype of the polymorphism rs6311 and the C / C genotype of the polymorphism rs6313 in the HTR2A gene are associated with the suicide attempt in schizophrenic patients . Correspondingly , an A allele , – ê/- genotypes of the polymorphism rs6311 G &gt; A and a T allele , T/- genotypes of the polymorphism rs6313 C &gt; T were found to be less frequent in schizophrenic patients with a history of suicide attempt than in schizophrenic patients without a history of suicide attempt , thus suggesting their protective role in the development of suicidal behavior .

OBJECTIVE : To determine the clinical consequences of pulmonary tuberculosis among patients with diabetes mellitus . METHODS : We conducted a prospective study of patients with TB in Southern Mexico . From 1995 to 2010 , patients with acid-fast bacilli or Mycobacterium tuberculosis in sputum samples underwent epidemiological , clinical and microbiological evaluation . Annual follow-ups were performed to ascertain treatment outcome , recurrence , relapse and reinfection . RESULTS : The prevalence of DM among 1262 patients with pulmonary TB was 29.63 % . Patients with DM and pulmonary TB had more severe clinical manifestations , delayed sputum conversion , a higher probability of treatment failure , recurrence and relapse . Most of the second episodes among patients with DM were caused by bacteria with the same genotype but , in 5 / 26 instances , reinfection with a different strain occurred . CONCLUSIONS : Given the growing epidemic of DM worldwide , it is necessary to add DM prevention and control strategies to TB control programmes and vice versa and to evaluate their effectiveness . The concurrence of both diseases potentially carries a risk of global spreading , with serious implications for TB control and the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals . 	2012	2012-12-20	Thorax;2013 Mar;68;3;214-20;	Jim√©nez-Corona,Mar√≠a Eugenia,ME;Cruz-Hervert,Luis Pablo,LP;Garc√≠a-Garc√≠a,Lourdes,L;Ferreyra-Reyes,Leticia,L;Delgado-S√°nchez,Guadalupe,G;Bobadilla-Del-Valle,Miriam,M;Canizales-Quintero,Sergio,S;Ferreira-Guerrero,Elizabeth,E;B√°ez-Salda√±a,Renata,R;T√	-1.35931
ERROR 22382594: 23272809	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characterization of a new formulation containing synergistic proportions of interferons alpha-2b and gamma in patients with mycosis fungoides : an open-label trial . 	ABSTRACT : BACKGROUND : The synergistic combination of interferon alpha-2b and IFN gamma results in more potent in vitro biological effects mediated by both IFNs . The aim of this investigation was to evaluate by first time the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this combination in patients with mycosis fungoides . METHODS : An exploratory , prospective , open-label clinical trial was conducted . Twelve patients , both genders , 18 to 75 years-old , with mycosis fungoides at stages IB to III , were eligible for the study . All of them received intramuscularly a single high dose of a novel synergistic IFN mixture for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies . Serum IFN alpha-2b and IFN gamma concentrations were measured during 96 hours by commercial enzyme immunoassays specific for each IFN . Other blood IFN-inducible markers and laboratory variables were used as pharmacodynamics and safety criteria . RESULTS : The pharmacokinetic evaluation by EIA yielded a similar pattern for both IFNs that are also in agreement with the well-known described profiles for these molecules when these are administered separately . The average values for main parameters were : Cmax : 263 and 9.3 pg / mL ; Tmax : 9.5 and 6.9 h ; AUC : 4483 and 87.5 pg.h / mL , half-life : 4.9 and 13.4 h ; mean residence time : 13.9 and 13.5 h , for serum IFN alpha-2b and IFN gamma , respectively . The pharmacodynamic variables were strongly stimulated by simultaneous administration of both IFNs : serum neopterin and beta-2 microglobulin levels , and stimulation of 2 &apos; -5 &apos; oligoadenylate synthetase mRNA expression . The most encouraging data was the high increment of serum neopterin , 8.0 ng / mL at 48 h , not been described before for any unmodified or pegylated IFN . Additionally , beta2M concentration doubled the pre-dose value at 24 -- 48 hours . For both variables the values remained clearly upper baseline levels at 96 hours . CONCLUSIONS : HeberPAG possesses improved pharmacodynamic properties that may be very useful in the oncologic setting . Efficacy trials can be carried out to confirm these findings .

The discovery of direct cell reprogramming and induced pluripotent stem cell technology opened up new avenues for the application of non-viral , transposon-based gene delivery systems . The Sleeping Beauty transposon is highly advanced for versatile genetic manipulations in mammalian cells . We established iPS cell reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human foreskin fibroblasts by transposition of OSKM and OSKML expression cassettes mobilized by the SB100X hyperactive transposase . The efficiency of iPS cell derivation with SB transposon system was in the range of that obtained with retroviral vectors . Co-expression of the miRNA302 / 367 cluster together with OSKM significantly improved reprogramming efficiency and accelerated the temporal kinetics of reprogramming . The iPS cells displayed a stable karyotype , and hallmarks of pluripotency including expression of stem cell markers and the ability to differentiate into embryoid bodies in vitro . We demonstrate Cre recombinase-mediated exchange allowing simultaneous removal of the reprogramming cassette and targeted knock-in of an expression cassette of interest into the transposon-tagged locus in mouse iPS cells . This strategy would allow correction of a genetic defect by site-specific insertion of a therapeutic gene construct into ' safe harbor ' sites in the genomes of autologous , patient-derived iPS cells . 	2013	2013-01-01	Nucleic acids research;2013 Feb 1;41;3;1829-47;	Grabundzija,Ivana,I;Wang,Jichang,J;Sebe,Attila,A;Erdei,Zsuzsanna,Z;Kajdi,Robert,R;Devaraj,Anantharam,A;Steinemann,Doris,D;Szuhai,K√°roly,K;Stein,Ulrike,U;Cantz,Tobias,T;Schambach,Axel,A;Baum,Christopher,C;Izsv√°k,Zsuzsanna,Z;Sarkadi,Bal√°zs,B;Ivics,Zolt√	-1.36806
ERROR 22397978: 23288874	Lack of Association of a Functional Catechol-O-Methyltransferase Gene Polymorphism With Risk of Tobacco Smoking : Results From a Multicenter Case-Control Study . 	BACKGROUND : The catechol-O-methyltransferase modulates dopaminergic neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex as well as in the mesolimbic reward system . Since the reward system mediates addictive behavior , the COMT gene is a strong candidate gene regarding the pathophysiology of tobacco dependence and smoking behavior . Because of rather conflicting results in previous studies , the purpose of the present study was to test for association between a functional genetic variant in the COMT gene and tobacco smoking behavior . METHODS : In a population-based case-control multicenter study designed for tobacco addiction research , a total of 551 current smokers of European ancestry and 548 age-matched healthy volunteers were genotyped for SNP rs4680 and extensively characterized concerning their smoking behavior . RESULTS : We found no association between smoking status and SNP rs4680 genotype nor did we find a significant association to the degree of tobacco dependence . CONCLUSIONS : Although prefrontal cortical and ventral striatal activity are highly relevant for addictive behavior , and under partial control of COMT rs4680 genotype , no association between COMT and smoking behavior was observed . Other genetic variants may account for the high heritability of behavioral smoking phenotypes . 	2013	2013-01-05	Nicotine &amp; tobacco research : official journal of the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco;2013 Jan 3;;;;	Mutschler,Jochen,J;Abbruzzese,Elvira,E;von der Goltz,Christoph,C;Dinter,Christina,C;Mobascher,Arian,A;Thiele,Holger,H;Diaz-Lacava,Amalia,A;Dahmen,Norbert,N;Gallinat,J√ºrgen,J;Majic,Tomislav,T;Petrovsky,Nadine,N;Thuerauf,Norbert,N;Kornhuber,Johannes,J;Gr√	-0.909821

Whether and how aldosterone is involved in the deleterious effects of cardiac mineralocorticoid activation is still unclear . Mice overexpressing MR in cardiomyocytes and their controls were treated for 7 days with aldosterone , and cardiac transcriptome was analyzed . Aldosterone regulated 265 genes in cardiomyocyte-targeted MR overexpression mice . Forty three of these genes were also differentially expressed between untreated cardiomyocyte-targeted MR overexpression and controls mice , thus representing putative aldosterone-regulated genes in cardiomyocytes . Among these genes , we focused on connective tissue growth factor . In vivo , in cardiomyocyte-targeted MR overexpression mice , aldosterone induced CTGF expression in cardiomyocytes . Ex vivo , aldosterone induced the binding of mineralocorticoid receptor to CTGF promoter and increased the expression of its transcript . Aldosterone induction of CTGF synthesis in cardiomyocytes seems pathologically relevant as the increase in CTGF observed in a model of heart failure in rats was prevented by eplerenone , a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker . This study demonstrates that aldosterone specifically regulates gene expression in cardiomyocytes despite large prevalence of glucocorticoids in plasma . 	2013	2013-01-09	Hypertension;2013 Feb;61;2;361-7;	Messaoudi,Smail,S;Gravez,Basile,B;Tarjus,Antoine,A;Pelloux,V√©ronique,V;Ouvrard-Pascaud,Antoine,A;Delcayre,Claude,C;Samuel,Janelise,J;Launay,Jean-Marie,JM;Sierra-Ramos,Catalina,C;Alvarez de la Rosa,Diego,D;Cl√©ment,Karine,K;Farman,Nicolette,N;Jaisser,Fr√	-1.1647

UNLABELLED : BACKGROUND # ENTITYSTARTX00026 ; AIMS : Recent studies reported a role for more than 70 genes or loci in the susceptibility to Crohn &apos; s disease . However , the impact of these associations in clinical practice remains to be defined . The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes for the main 53 CD-associated polymorphisms . METHOD : A cohort of 798 CD patients with a median follow up of 7 years was recruited by tertiary adult and paediatric gastroenterological centres . A detailed phenotypic description of the disease was recorded , including clinical presentation , response to treatments and complications . The participants were genotyped for 53 CD-associated variants previously reported in the literature and correlations with clinical sub-phenotypes were searched for . A replication cohort consisting of 722 CD patients was used to further explore the putative associations . RESULTS : The NOD2 rare variants were associated with an earlier age at diagnosis and an ileal involvement . Colonic lesions were positively associated with the risk alleles of IL23R rs11209026 and 6q21 rs7746082 The ATG16L1 and IRGM variants were associated with a non-inflammatory behaviour . However , these associations lost significance after multiple testing corrections . The protective effect of the IRGM risk allele on colonic lesions was the only association replicated in the second cohort .

ERROR 22412426: 23303409	Synergistic effect of uricase blockade plus physiological amounts of fructose-glucose on glomerular hypertension and oxidative stress in rats . 	Fructose in sweetened beverages increases the risk for metabolic and cardiorenal disorders , and these effects are in part mediated by a secondary increment in uric acid . Rodents have an active uricase , thus requiring large doses of fructose to increase plasma UA and to induce metabolic syndrome and renal hemodynamic changes . We therefore hypothesized that the effects of fructose in rats might be enhanced in the setting of uricase inhibition . Four groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied during 8 wk : water + vehicle , water + oxonic acid , sweetened beverage + V , and SB + OA . Systemic blood pressure , plasma UA , triglycerides , glucose and insulin , glomerular hemodynamics , renal structural damage , renal cortex and liver UA , TG , markers of oxidative stress , mitDNA , fructokinase , and fatty liver synthase protein expressions were evaluated at the end of the experiment . Chronic hyperuricemia and SB induced features of the metabolic syndrome , including hypertension , hyperuricemia , hyperglycemia , and systemic and hepatic TG accumulation . OA alone also induced glomerular hypertension , and SB alone induced insulin resistance . SB + OA induced a combined phenotype including metabolic and renal alterations induced by SB or OA alone and in addition also acted synergistically on systemic and glomerular pressure , plasma glucose , hepatic TG , and oxidative stress . These findings explain why high concentrations of fructose are required to induce greater metabolic changes and renal disease in rats whereas humans , who lack uricase , appear to be much more sensitive to the effects of fructose . 	2013	2013-01-11	American journal of physiology.

BACKGROUND : : The expression and distribution of farnesoid X receptor in colitis and colitis-associated neoplasia is unknown . We investigated FXR expression in neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissue from ulcerative colitis patients , with or without primary sclerosing cholangitis , as well as the role of DNA methylation in FXR expression in colorectal cancer cell lines . METHODS : : Samples from the right and left colon of patients with UC , with and without PSC , and with or without CAN , were stained by immunohistochemistry and scored semiquantitatively for nuclear FXR expression . FXR expression was analyzed by western blot and polymerase chain reaction in nine different CRC cell lines before and after demethylation with 5-azacytidine . RESULTS : : In nondysplastic samples , FXR expression demonstrated a diminishing expression from proximal to distal colon . With moderate-to-severe inflammation , FXR expression was almost always absent or weak in both UC and PSC-UC , regardless of location . With quiescent / mild inflammation , 56 % of UC samples in the RC retained strong FXR expression versus 24 % of PSC-UC samples . FXR was absent in 72 % of the neoplastic samples , with an inverse association with the grade of dysplasia . FXR expression was absent in all CRC cell lines , in some cases due to DNA methylation . CONCLUSIONS : : FXR expression is inversely correlated with neoplastic progression and severity of inflammation in UC . Patients with PSC-UC have diminished FXR expression in the proximal colon compared to UC patients .

The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of the nitric oxide / cyclic guanylate monophosphate pathway in pilocarpine-induced seizures in mice . Male Swiss mice were used as the in vivo model . The following pharmacological tools were utilized : the non-selective NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME , a preferential inducible NOS inhibitor aminoguanidine , a highly specific iNOS inhibitor 1400W , the NO donor L-arginine , and the soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ . The animals were divided into groups and pretreated for 30 min before receiving pilocarpine , while the control group received only pilocarpine . They were observed for 60 min to measure initial seizure latency , latency till death , and mortality . An administration of L-NAME or ODQ delayed the onset of initial seizure , increased latency till death , and produced a 25 % survival rate . Aminoguanidine increased the initial seizure and latency until death , and administration of 1400W did not have an effect .

The precise link between hyperglycemia and its deleterious effects on retinal and kidney microvasculature , and more specifically loss of retinal perivascular supporting cells including smooth muscle cell / pericytes , in diabetes are not completely understood . We hypothesized that differential cellular proteasome activity contributes to sensitivity of PC to high glucose-mediated oxidative stress and vascular rarefaction . Here we show that retinal endothelial cells have significantly higher proteasome peptidase activity compared to PC . High glucose treatment increased the level of total ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in cultured retinal PC and EC , but not photoreceptor cells . In addition , in vitro proteasome activity assays showed significant impairment of proteasome chymotrypsin-like peptidase activity in PC , but not EC . The PA28-Œ ±/- Œ≤ and PA28-Œ ≤/- Œ≥ protein levels were also higher in the retina and kidney glomeruli of diabetic mice , respectively .

ERROR 22521782: 23417991	Dact gene expression profiles suggest a role for this gene family in integrating Wnt and TGF-Œ≤ signaling pathways during chicken limb development . 	Background : Dact gene family encodes multifunctional proteins that are important modulators of Wnt and TGF-Œ≤ signaling pathways . Given that these pathways coordinate multiple steps of limb development , we investigated the expression pattern of the two chicken Dact genes from early limb bud up to stages when several tissues are differentiating . Results : During early limb development Dact1 and Dact2 were mainly expressed in the cartilaginous rudiments of the appendicular skeleton and perichondrium , presenting expression profiles related , but distinct . At later stages of development , the main sites of Dact1 and Dact2 expression were the developing synovial joints . In this context , Dact1 expression was shown to co-localize with regions enriched in the nuclear Œ≤-catenin protein , such as developing joint capsule and interzone . In contrast , Dact2 expression was restricted to the interzone surrounding the domains of bmpR-1b expression , a TGF-Œ≤ receptor with crucial roles during digit morphogenesis . Additional sites of Dact expression were the developing tendons and digit blastemas . Conclusions : Our data indicate that Dact genes are good candidates to modulate and , possibly , integrate Wnt and TGF-Œ≤ signaling during limb development , bringing new and interesting perspectives about the roles of Dact molecules in limb birth defects and human diseases .

ERROR 22525205: 23421421	Urodynamic evaluation : can it prevent the need for surgical intervention in women with apparent pure stress urinary incontinence ? 	OBJECTIVES : To identify how many patients with symptoms of pure stress urinary incontinence do not require any surgical treatment on the basis of urodynamics and how many patients still do not require surgery 1 year after UDS . To assess the outcomes of these patients at 12-month follow-up . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Women with pure SUI received UDS and were prospectively divided into four groups , comprising women with : urodynamic stress incontinence ; detrusor overactivity ; USI + DO ; and inconclusive UDS . Women with USI underwent a Tension Free Vaginal Tape procedure , whereas women with DO ¬ ±/- USI were recommended 24-week antimuscarinic therapy . Follow-up was scheduled at 3 and 12 months . To define subjective outcomes , all patients completed the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - short form , the Patient Global Impression - Improvement and the Urinary Distress Inventory . Patients were considered cured if they presented a negative stress test , a score reduction of at least 80 % on the Urinary Distress Inventory and a response of &apos; much better &apos; or &apos; very much better &apos; on the Patient Global Impression - Improvement . RESULTS : Of the 263 women with pure SUI , 74.5 % had a urodynamic diagnosis of USI , 10.6 % had DO , 8 % had USI + DO and 6.8 % had inconclusive UDS . At 12-month follow-up , 165 / 181 women in group 1 were considered cured post-TVT-O ; in the other groups , 33 / 67 patients were considered cured simply as a result of taking antimuscarinics ; 13 of these 67 patients required TVT-O . CONCLUSIONS : UDS is able to show that several patients with symptoms of pure SUI present an underlying DO and do not require surgery , even 1 year after UDS . In these patients , antimuscarinic treatment appears to ensure a good rate of cure ; thus , UDS could lead to the avoidance of several surgical procedures . 	2013	2013-02-21	BJU international;2013 Feb 20;;;;	Serati,Maurizio,M;Cattoni,Elena,E;Siesto,Gabriele,G;Braga,Andrea,A;Sorice,Paola,P;Cantaluppi,Simona,S;Cromi,Antonella,A;Ghezzi,Fabio,F;Vitobello,Domenico,D;Bolis,Pierfrancesco,P;Salvatore,Stefano,S;	-1.25626
ERROR 22529140: 23425541	Safety of lone thrombus aspiration without concomitant coronary stenting in selected patients with acute myocardial infarction . 	Aims : Although the benefit of concomitant thrombus aspiration in primary percutaneous coronary intervention treatment of acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction has been demonstrated , very little information is available on its safety as a lone revascularisation technique in this setting . We present our experience in a cohort of patients with STEMI treated only with TA , without concomitant interventional devices . Methods and results : In 28 patients with STEMI , PPCI was performed using only TA on the grounds of an excellent angiographic result and in order to avoid the potential risks associated with balloon dilatation or stenting . The patients were younger than in the overall PPCI population at our institution , with a history of atrial fibrillation in six , cocaine abuse in three and mechanical cardiac valves in two . Twenty-eight patients presented STEMI with Killip class I , two with cardiogenic shock , and two with sudden cardiac death . A significant reduction in TIMI thrombus grade and coronary stenosis percentage as well as an increase in final TIMI flow and minimum luminal diameter were noted after TA . Transient no-reflow phenomenon , residual intracoronary thrombus and minor distal thrombus embolisation were observed in two , 11 and 10 patients , respectively . All but one patient remained asymptomatic during hospital admission . Scheduled control angiography was performed 6¬±2 days after PPCI in 11 patients , demonstrating coronary artery patency and TIMI flow grade 3 in all patients . During clinical follow-up , successfully performed in all patients at 40¬±23 months , there was one sudden cardiac death and three non-cardiac deaths . One patient was admitted with non-STEMI and the remaining 22 remained asymptomatic and free of cardiac events . Conclusions : Our series suggests that lone TA might be safely performed as a primary revascularisation procedure in STEMI in selected cases . Further information based on additional and larger studies is recommended to confirm our findings . 	2013	2013-02-22	EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology;2013 Feb 22;8;10;1149-56;	Escaned,Javier,J;Echavarr√≠a-Pinto,Mauro,M;Gorgadze,Tamara,T;Gonzalo,Nieves,N;Armengol,Fernanda,F;Hern√°ndez,Rosana,R;Jim√©nez-Quevedo,Pilar,P;Nu√±ez-Gil,Ivan J,IJ;P√©rez-Vizcayno,Maria Jos√©,MJ;Alfonso,Fernando,F;Ba√±uelos,Camino,C;Iba√±ez,Borja,B;Garc√	-1.21768

Studies suggest the influence of immune response on the successful treatment of American tegumentary leishmaniasis , and indicate the existence of protective immunity in self-healed patients . Thus , the aim of this work was to quantify interferon-gamma , tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin 10 , IL-17 , IL-22 and nitric oxide in culture supernatants of PBMC from patients with active disease , after treatment , and from self-healed and healthy subjects , in response to Leishmania braziliensis insoluble antigen .

AD and AT patients presented TNF-Œ± levels , with a slight increase after therapy , whereas it was weakly quantified in SH . Interestingly , NO secretion was significant in these individuals , whereas IL-17 appeared in low levels and seems to be regulated by NO . Although IL-22 was detected in AD , its role is still questionable . The presence of IL-10 in all groups of patients suggests that the cytokine plays distinct roles in the disease . These results indicate that specific cellular immunity takes part against Leishmania , but with some similarities between the different clinical states herein described ; these mediators seem to be necessary for the cure to occur . 	2013	2013-02-23	Microbial pathogenesis;2013 Feb 18;;;;	de Assis Souza,Marina,M;Castro,Maria Carolina A B,MC;de Oliveira,Andresa Pereira,AP;de Almeida,Amanda Ferreira,AF;de Almeida,Thays Miranda,TM;de Campos Reis,Luiza,L;Medeiros,Angela Cristina Rapela,AC;de Brito,Maria Edileuza Felinto,ME;Pereira,Val√©ria R√	-1.21628

AIMS : Several reports have suggested that nitrates limit acute ischaemic damage by a mechanism similar to preconditioning . This study aims to evaluate the effect of chronic oral nitrates on the clinical presentation and short-term outcomes of patients admitted with acute coronary syndrome . METHODS : A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients with ACS admitted to 62 acute care units from 2010 to 2011 . A propensity score-matched samples analysis was performed . RESULTS : We analysed 3171 consecutive patients , of whom 298 were chronically treated with nitrates . Patients previously treated with nitrates had higher comorbidity and disease severity at admission , lower prevalence of ACS with ST elevation , lower troponin elevation , higher prevalence of initial Killip class 2-4 and higher hospital mortality . The propensity score-matched analysis confirmed that previous use of nitrates is independently associated with a lower prevalence of ST-elevation ACS and a lower troponin elevation but not with Killip class on admission or mortality .

Background and Aims : The aim of this study was to assess factors that have an effect on the accuracy of self-reported weight and height in adolescents . Methods : Weight and height of 3,865 European adolescents aged 12.5 to 17.5 years were self-reported via specific questionnaire . Then real weight and height were measured using accurate equipment and standardized protocols . Differences between self-reported and measured weight and height were calculated , and factors that could have influenced the accuracy of self-reported weight and height were assessed . Data were analyzed using ANOVA , Student 's t test and multivariate regression . Results : Adolescents underestimated their weight and overestimated their height . Obese girls underestimated their weight and overestimated their height to a greater extent than obese boys . Underestimation of weight and overestimation of height were only significant for girls who had finished puberty . Socioeconomic status , nutritional knowledge , physical fitness , physical activity level , food choice and preference , and healthy eating behaviour had no significant influence on the accuracy of self-reported weight and height . Conclusion : Our data confirms that self-reports of weight and height made by adolescents are inaccurate and demonstrate that inaccuracy is strongly influenced by nutritional status , pubertal status and gender . 	2013	2013-03-15	Annals of nutrition &amp; metabolism;2013 Mar 6;62;3;187-198;	B√©ghin,Laurent,L;Huybrechts,Inge,I;Ortega,Franscico B,FB;Coopman,St√©phanie,S;Manios,Yannis,Y;Wijnhoven,Trudy M A,TM;Duhamel,Alain,A;Ciarapica,Donatella,D;Gilbert,Chantal C,CC;Kafatos,Anthony,A;Widhalm,Kurt,K;Molnar,Denes,D;Moreno,Luis A,LA;Gottrand,Fr√	-1.20533

ERROR 22627490: 23531155	Inhibition of ovine in vitro fertilization by anti-Prt antibody : hypothetical model for Prt / ZP interaction . 	BACKGROUND : The impact of prion proteins in the rules that dictate biological reproduction is still poorly understood . Likewise , the role of prnt gene , encoding the prion-like protein testis specific , in ram reproductive physiology remains largely unknown . In this study , we assessed the effect of Prt in ovine fertilization by using an anti-Prt antibody in fertilization medium incubated with spermatozoa and oocytes . Moreover , a computational model was constructed to infer how the results obtained could be related to a hypothetical role for Prt in sperm-zona pellucida binding . METHODS : Mature ovine oocytes were transferred to fertilization medium alone or supplemented with APPA , or pre-immune serum . Oocytes were inseminated with ovine spermatozoa and after 18h , presumptive zygotes were fixed to evaluate fertilization rates or transferred for embryo culture until D6-7 . Predicted ovine Prt tertiary structure was compared with data obtained by circular dichroism spectroscopy and a protein-protein computational docking model was estimated for a hypothetical Prt / ZP interaction . RESULTS : The fertilizing rate was lower in APPA group when compared to control and CSerum groups . In addition , the cleavage rate was higher in control than in APPA group . Prt CD spectroscopy showed a 22 % alpha-helical structure in 30 % aqueous trifluoroethanol and 17 % alpha in 0.6 % TFE . The predominant alpha-helical secondary structure detected correlates with the predicted three dimensional structure for ovine Prt , which was subsequently used to test Prt / ZP docking . Computational analyses predicted a favorable Prt-binding activity towards ZP domains . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicates that the presence of APPA reduces the number of fertilized oocytes and of cleaved embryos . Moreover , the CD analysis data reinforces the predicted ovine Prt trend towards an alpha-helical structure . Predicted protein-protein docking suggests a possible interaction between Prt and ZP , thus supporting an important role for Prt in ovine fertilization . 	2013	2013-03-28	Reproductive biology and endocrinology : RB&amp;E;2013 Mar 26;11;1;25;	Pimenta,Jorge,J;Sardinha,Jo√£o,J;Marques,Carla C,CC;Domingos,Ana,A;Baptista,Maria C,MC;Barbas,Jo√£o P,JP;Martins,Ivo C,IC;Mesquita,Patr√≠cia,P;Pessa,Pedro,P;Soares,Rui,R;Viegas,Aldino,A;Cabrita,Eurico,E;Horta,Ant√≥nio Em,AE;Fontes,Carlos A,CA;Prates,Jos√	-0.606916

ERROR 22653228: 23557477	The Role of Arene-Arene Interactions in the Folding of ortho-Phenylenes . 	The ortho-phenylenes are a simple class of helical oligomers and representative of the broader class of sterically congested polyphenylenes . Recent work has shown that o-phenylenes fold into well-defined helical conformations ; however , the specific causes of this folding behavior have not been determined . Here , we report the effect of substituents on the conformational distributions of a series of o-phenylene hexamers . These experiments are complemented by dispersion-corrected DFT calculations on model oligomers . The results are consistent with a deterministic role for offset arene-arene stacking interactions on the folding behavior . On the basis of the experimental and computational results , we propose a model for o-phenylene folding with two simple rules . Conformers are forbidden if they include a particular sequence of biaryl torsional states that causes excessive steric strain . These " ABA " states correspond to consecutive dihedral angles of -55¬∞ / +130¬ ∞/- 55¬∞ . The stability of the remaining conformers is determined by offset arene-arene stacking interactions that are easily estimated as an additive function of the number of well-folded torsional states along the backbone . For the parent , unsubstituted poly , each interaction contributes roughly 0.5 kcal / mol to the helix stability , although their strength is sensitive to substituent effects . The behavior of the o-phenylenes as a class is discussed in the context of this model . They are analogous to Œ±-helices , with axial aromatic stacking interactions in place of hydrogen bonding . The model predicts that the overall folding propensity should be quite sensitive to relatively small changes in the strength of the arene-arene stacking . In a broader sense , these results demonstrate that polyphenylenes may exhibit folding behavior that is amenable to simple models , and validate the use of diffusion-corrected DFT methods in predicting their three-dimensional structures . 	2013	2013-04-06	Journal of the American Chemical Society;2013 Apr 4;;;;	Mathew,Sanyo M,SM;Engle,James T,JT;Ziegler,Christopher John,CJ;Hartley,Christopher Scott,CS;	-0.783155

BACKGROUND : Some recent experimental data suggest a possible role of LINGO-1 in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis . In an attempt to identify genetic biomarkers related to MS susceptibility , we genotyped two common SNPs in the LINGO1 gene which have been associated to other neurological conditions , in patients with MS and in healthy subjects . These SNPs are linked to several SNPs within the LINGO1 gene , especially in individuals of Oriental or Caucasian descent . METHODS : We analyzed the allelic and genotype frequency of two LINGO1 variants in 293 patients with MS and 318 healthy controls , using KASPar assays . RESULTS : LINGO1 rs9652490 and rs11856808 allelic and genotype frequencies did not differ significantly between MS patients and controls . The minor allele frequencies for rs9652490 were 0.171 and 0.167 For rs11856808 the minor allele frequencies were 0.317 and 0.310 for cases and controls , respectively .

BACKGROUND : Inflammatory mechanisms involving complement activation has been shown to take part in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure , but the initiating mechanisms are unknown . We hypothesized that the main initiator molecules of the lectin complement pathway mannose-binding lectin , ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 were related to disease severity and outcome in chronic heart failure . METHODS AND RESULTS : MBL , ficolin-2 and ficolin-3 plasma concentrations were determined in two consecutive cohorts comprising 190 patients from Hungary and 183 patients from Norway as well as controls . Disease severity and clinical parameters were determined at baseline , and all-cause mortality was registered after 5-years follow-up . In univariate analysis a low level of ficolin-3 , but not that of MBL or ficolin-2 , was significantly associated with advanced heart failure and showed inverse correlation with B- type natriuretic peptide levels . In multivariable Cox regression analysis , adjusted for age , gender and BNP , decreased plasma ficolin-3 was a significant predictor of mortality . Low ficolin-3 levels were associated with increased complement activation product C3a and correspondingly decreased concentrations of complement factor C3 . CONCLUSIONS : This study provides evidence for an association of low ficolin-3 levels with advanced heart failure . Concordant results from two cohorts show that low levels of ficolin-3 are associated with advanced heart failure and outcome .

Latitude gradient , vitamin D deficiency and season of birth are among the most investigated environmental factors associated with the disease . Several international studies suggest that birth in spring is a substantial risk factor for MS . We investigated the season of birth as a potential risk for MS in different geographical regions of Brazil . We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study with 2257 clinically definite MS patients enrolled in 13 Brazilian MS clinics in the south , southeast , and northeast regions of Brazil . Demographic and clinical data relating to date of birth and clinical features of the disease were collected and analysed , and subsequently compared with birth date among the general Brazilian population . The distribution of date of birth of MS patients showed an increase in spring and a decrease in autumn , with no difference being observed in the other seasons . In conclusion , season of birth is a probable risk factor for MS in most parts of Brazil . These findings may be related to the role that vitamin D plays in MS pathogenesis . 	2013	2013-04-20	Journal of the neurological sciences;2013 Apr 15;;;;	Becker,Jefferson,J;Callegaro,Dagoberto,D;Lana-Peixoto,Marco Aur√©lio,MA;Ferreira,Maria L√∫cia B,ML;Melo,Ailton,A;Diniz da Gama,Paulo,P;Souza,Doralina G B,DG;Teixeira,Carlos A C,CA;Kaimen-Maciel,Damacio Ram√≥n,DR;Gon√ßalves,Marcus Vin√≠cius,MV;Matta,Andr√	-1.15972

Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been developed as an alternative transplant strategy for children with hematological disorders who do not have an HLA-matched donor . We report the analysis of the outcome for 18 consecutive pediatric patients with various hematological diseases , who underwent haplo-HSCT using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and CD3 / CD19 depletion in an outpatient setting . Twelve of the 18 patients engrafted either transiently or definitively . Six patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were disease-free between 2 and 35 months post-HSCT . The overall survival was 33.3 % with a median of 25 months . Our results suggest that haplo-HSCT can be a feasible therapeutic alternative for children who do not have a suitable family donor or available cord blood units . These results also demonstrate that it is possible to perform this regimen on an outpatient basis . 	2013	2013-04-23	Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands);2013 Apr 18;;;;	Gonz√°lez-Llano,Oscar,O;Rodr√≠guez-Romo,Laura Nelly,LN;Manc√≠as-Guerra,Mar√≠a Del Consuelo,MD;Tar√≠n-Arzaga,Luz,L;Jaime-P√©rez,Jos√© Carlos,JC;Herrera-Garza,Jos√© Luis,JL;Cant√∫-Rodr√≠guez,Olga Graciela,OG;Guti√©rrez-Aguirre,C√©sar Homero,CH;Garc√≠a-Sep√	-1.05601
ERROR 22700557: 23607186	Comparative analysis of autodermal graft and polypropylene mesh use in large incisional hernia defects reconstruction . 	BACKGROUND : Large defects of the abdominal wall caused by incisional hernia still represent a challenging problem in plastic , reconstructive , and abdominal surgery . For their successful tension-free repair a proper selection of reconstructive material is essential . In the last decades , the use of synthetic meshes was dominant while biological autodermal grafts were rarely used . The aim of the study was to comparatively analyse efficacy and safety of autodermal graft and polypropylene mesh in surgical treatment of large abdominal wall defects . METHODS : This prospective comparative clinical study enroled 40 patients surgically treated for large incisional hernia repair in a 10-year period . The patients were divided into two equal groups consisting of 20 subjects and treated either by biological autodermal graft or by synthetic polypropylene mesh . The surgical techniques of reconstruction , duration of surgery , the occurrence of early , minor , and major and delyed complications and hospital stay were analysed . The average follow-up took 2 years . RESULTS : Statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics of patients and in size of defects were not found . The surgical technique of reconstruction with an autodermal graft was more complicated . The duration of surgery in patients treated with autodermal grafts was significantly longer . There was no statistically significant difference regarding occurrence of early , minor postoperative complications and hospital stay in our study . Two severe complications were registered in the synthetic mesh group : intestinal obstruction and enterocutaneous fistula . The recurrence rate was 10 % in the autodermal graft group and 15 % in the group with a synthetic mesh . CONCLUSION : Tension-free repair of large incisional hernia with autodermal grafts was unjustly neglected despite the fact that it is safe and effective . It can be applied in all cases where synthetic mesh are not indicated . They are especially important in war surgery and in lack of funds when commercial grafts can not be purchased . 	2013	2013-04-24	Vojnosanitetski pregled.

ERROR 22702433: 23609066	Impact of Transesophageal Electrophysiologic Study to Elucidate the Mechanism of Arrhythmia on Children With Supraventricular Tachycardia and No Preexcitation . 	An electrophysiologic study of children and teenagers with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and normal electrocardiography in sinus rhythm was evaluated . Generally , EPS is performed only before paroxysmal SVT ablation in these patients . In this study , 140 patients with normal ECG in sinus rhythm were studied for SVT by a transesophageal route in baseline state and after isoproterenol . Idiopathic left or right ventricular tachycardia was diagnosed in four patients . Anterograde conduction over an atrioventricular left lateral or septal accessory pathway was noted in 19 patients at atrial pacing . Orthodromic AV reentrant tachycardia was induced in these children . Five of the patients had a high rate conducted over AP . Two of the patients had the criteria for a malignant form with the induction of atrial fibrillation conducted over AP at a rate exceeding 290¬†bpm in baseline state . Of the 140 patients , 74 had typical AV node reentrant tachycardia , nine had atypical AVNRT , 1 had atrial tachycardia , and 33 had AVRT related to a concealed AP with only retrograde conduction . Electrophysiologic study is recommended for children with paroxysmal SVT and normal ECG in sinus rhythm . The data are helpful for guiding the treatment . Ventricular tachycardia or atrial tachycardia can be misdiagnosed . Masked preexcitation syndrome with anterograde conduction through AP was present in 13.5¬† % of the patients , and 1.4¬† % had a malignant preexcitation syndrome . 	2013	2013-04-24	Pediatric cardiology;2013 Apr 23;;;;	Brembilla-Perrot,B√©atrice,B;Moulin-Zinsch,A,A;Sellal,J M,JM;Schwartz,J,J;Olivier,A,A;Zinzius,P Y,PY;De Chillou,C,C;Beurrier,D,D;Rodermann,M,M;Goudote,G,G;Al Amoura,H,H;Terrier de la Chaise,A,A;Lemoine,J,J;Rizk,J,J;Lethor,J P,JP;Anne Tisserand,J L,JL;Ta√	-1.14348

Fanconi anemia is a rare genomic instability disorder characterized by progressive bone marrow failure and predisposition to cancer . FA-associated gene products are involved in the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks . Fifteen FA-associated genes have been identified , but the genetic basis in some individuals still remains unresolved . Here , we used whole-exome and Sanger sequencing on DNA of unclassified FA individuals and discovered biallelic germline mutations in ERCC4 , a structure-specific nuclease-encoding gene previously connected to xeroderma pigmentosum and segmental XFE progeroid syndrome . Genetic reversion and wild-type ERCC4 cDNA complemented the phenotype of the FA cell lines , providing genetic evidence that mutations in ERCC4 cause this FA subtype . Further biochemical and functional analysis demonstrated that the identified FA-causing ERCC4 mutations strongly disrupt the function of XPF in DNA ICL repair without severely compromising nucleotide excision repair .

ERROR 22722851: 23630589	FGF21 Can Be Mimicked In Vitro and In Vivo by a Novel Anti-FGFR1c / Œ≤-Klotho Bispecific Protein . 	The endocrine hormone FGF21 has attracted considerable interest as a potential therapeutic for treating diabetes and obesity . As an alternative to the native cytokine , we generated bispecific Avimer polypeptides that bind with high affinity and specificity to one of the receptor and coreceptor pairs used by FGF21 , FGFR1c and Œ≤-Klotho . These Avimers exhibit FGF21-like activity in in vitro assays with potency greater than FGF21 . In a study conducted in obese male cynomolgus monkeys , animals treated with an FGFR1c / Œ≤-Klotho bispecific Avimer showed improved metabolic parameters and reduced body weight comparable to the effects seen with FGF21 . These results not only demonstrate the essential roles of FGFR1c and Œ≤-Klotho in mediating the metabolic effects of FGF21 , they also describe a first bispecific activator of this unique receptor complex and provide validation for a novel therapeutic approach to target this potentially important pathway for treating diabetes and obesity . 	2013	2013-05-01	PloS one;2013;8;4;e61432;	Smith,Richard,R;Duguay,Amy,A;Bakker,Alice,A;Li,Peng,P;Weiszmann,Jennifer,J;Thomas,Melissa R,MR;Alba,Benjamin M,BM;Wu,Xinle,X;Gupte,Jamila,J;Yang,Li,L;Stevens,Jennitte,J;Hamburger,Agnes,A;Smith,Stephen,S;Chen,Jiyun,J;Komorowski,Renee,R;Moore,Kevin W,KW;V√	-0.0619801

ERROR 22757336: 23666295	Epidemiology of atrial fibrillation in Turkey : preliminary results of the multicenter AFTER study . 	Objectives : Although atrial fibrillation is one of the most common rhythm disorders observed in clinical practice , a multicenter epidemiological study has not been conducted in our country . This study aimed to assess our clinical approach to AF based upon the records of the first multicenter prospective Atrial Fibrillation in Turkey : Epidemiologic Registry study . Study design : Taking into consideration the distribution of the population in our country , 2242 consecutive patients with at least one AF attack determined by electrocardiographic examination in 17 different tertiary health care centers were included in the study . Inpatients and patients that were admitted to emergency departments were excluded from the study . Epidemiological data of the patients and the treatment administered were assessed . Results : The mean age of the patients was determined as 66.8¬±12.3 years with female patients representing 60 % of the study population . While the most common AF type in the Turkish population was non-valvular AF , persistent / permanent AF was determined in 81 % of all patients . Hypertension was the most common co-morbidity in patients with AF . While a stroke or transient ischemic attack or history of systemic thromboembolism was detected in 15.3 % of the patients , bleeding history was recorded in 11.2 % . Also , 50 % of the patients were on warfarin treatment and 53 % were on aspirin treatment at the time of the study . The effective INR level was detected in 41.3 % of the patients . The most frequent cause of not receiving anticoagulant therapy was physician neglect . Conclusion : These results demonstrate the necessity for improved quality of physician care of patients with AF , especially with regards to antithrombotic therapy . 	2013	2013-05-15	T√ºrk Kardiyoloji Derneƒüi ar≈üivi : T√ºrk Kardiyoloji Derneƒüinin yayƒ±n organƒ±dƒ±r;2013 Mar;41;2;99-104;	Erta≈ü,Faruk,F;Kaya,Hasan,H;Kaya,Zekeriya,Z;Bulur,Serkan,S;K√∂se,Nuri,N;G√ºl,Mehmet,M;Kahya Eren,Nihan,N;Caƒülƒ±yan,Caƒülar Emre,CE;K√∂roƒülu,Bayram,B;Vatan,B√ºlent,B;Acar,G√∂ksel,G;Y√ºksel,Murat,M;Bilik,Mehmet Zihni,MZ;Gedik,Sel√ßuk,S;Sim≈üek,Ziya,Z;Akƒ	-1.52627
